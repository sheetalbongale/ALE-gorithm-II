I don't agree with all of Unibrou's offerings, but La Fin is truly one of the best representation of Belgian ale brewed outside of Belgium. And, a lot cheaper. 750ml bottle purchased all over the USA. If there's any detraction, it would be it's sweeter than some would like.

58,StevieW,"Big 750ml brown bottle. Cork and cage. Batch # 5. Opened with a loud sharp ""pop"". Murky deep carmel brown color. Glowing with hints of light gold around the edges. Beautiful, pillowly soft and creamy tan head. Covers the body of the beer perfectly and clings to the glass. Visually stunning. Aromas that are matched by no other beer, that I have experienced. Smooth soft spices, pepper, cinnamon, earthy nutmeg and tart fresh brabdy soaked orange peels to finish. The first taste was striking. Soft, subtle combinations of the above mentioned flavors all sitting perfectly on a sweet carmel malt backbone. The end is a softly presented shot of moderate hops. Candied apples, rum soaked raisans just whisper by. Hop stickyness lingers. Again the taste and smell of this one, is clearly stunning. Nothing like it. Perfection, IMO. Smooth, so smooth creamy medium bodied feel. Perfectly balanced. Yeasty sediment settles into the bottom of the glass. Earthy full flavors explode. A great winter belgian made by the good people of Maine. One of the best I have had in any category. Seek this out, please. P.S. I need to go to confession after reading the LongBeachBum's review.

61,california_republic,"Look: Cola brown with a thick, lasting foam that coats the sides in a layer when subsiding. Dark but clear without cloudiness or particulates. Respectable looking. Smell: Sweet roasted barley with a strong caramel dulce de leche note. There is also a lot of liquorice in the smell, emphasis in the liquor spelling of the word. Herbal licorice smell is definitely a sign of the hoppiness of the beer. Dried stone fruit rounds off the edge of the smell, giving it a fruitiness that definitely reminds me of that extra large muffin-shaped Christmas fruitcake that you get from Costco when it's the season. Complex with many notes, the smell is quite pleasant and truly excellent. Taste: Starts off with strong roasted malts with a sweetness like a coffee with sugar. Followed by tastes that are similar to how it smells, but with more dried fruit notes of raisin and prunes. Finish: Finishes roasted like a good medium-dark roast of coffee. Herbal notes leave the palate last, combined with the sweetness it is like a good piece of licorice. Overall: An excellent, classic porter that pushes the envelope by being refined yet approachable instead of over-the-top. A lot of the celebrated god-tier beers in the craft world are double/imperial styles that throw an ungodly amount of hops to try to impress you, but Anchor porter keeps it down to earth. Dark, sweet, fragrant, malty, hoppy, and not too bitter, it is to dark beers what Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is to pale ales. An outstanding beer that anyone can enjoy, whether you're a light beer casual or a DIPA elitist.

There is nothing wrong with liking this style or other beers with ""less flavor"". Each style has it's purpose and comparing a Budweiser to something like an Old Rasputin is ridiculous. There is a reason that this beer sells like crazy. In the future I think the rating category of price should be included. This is one of my go-tos.

79,DanielMB,"L: This poured a deep copper brown with some red notes to it, a very inviting appearance. S: Caramel, butterscotch, some toffee, vanilla, strong malts, and something like a caramel-apple pop. T: Very similar to the smell, so, in a word--delicious. I could barely believe I was drinking a BEER, not some sort of dessert. The overwhelming flavors are of caramel and butterscotch, then some vanilla, an almost apple-like flavor in there somewhere, with some malts and a tiny sort of alchol presence way in the back, which helps remind you that this great brew is, in fact, a beer, not a milkshake of some sort. M: Nice and robust, not too thick but not super-light or fizzy or anything like that. O: This is an absolutely stellar brew.

83,sudz42,"This is an exceptional, easy quaffing Oktoberfest, surprisingly refreshing for the style; belying its amber hue and frothy head. I was reluctant to buy and be stuck with the 12er (you know the feeling), anticipating a potential malt syrup bomb, but I am pleasantly surprised, and may be scoring another 12er before supply runs out. The trademark Becks soft water feel is marred by an underlying astringency, like a macro hop bitterness. This Oktoberfest is a welcome change from the typical Ringwood yeast ale diacetyl sugar shack disasters that are readily available in New England. Becks is the #1 German import for a reason, friends. They've done it again here. Prost!",4.63,Beck's Oktoberfest,German Märzen / Oktoberfest

133,hustlesworth,"poured into ayinger stange, the way i had it when it was first served to me at the sharp edge, pittsburgh, pa. here's to my 500th review. a trifle to some but a landmark to my vagrant ass. A- a beer so highly sought after by me and so highly esteemed is more than worthy of my appreciation. if this is an export lager than what the hell do they keep in germany? pours a chill hazed golden amber. more lemony yellow upon inspection. the head is beautiful. european by all means and unquestionably german. does this go without saying? white, rocky, buildable, sturdy, and puffy like a cloud as it rises over the lip of the glass. i've longed to have this on my computer desk to give it an honest to goodness review (as opposed to half drunk in a bar). lacemeister on check, chunky and sticky and everything i seek. S- crisp pale grainy aroma with lemon and pepper. herbal and grassy and cleaner than the dortmunders i'm accustomed to. straightforward malt sweetness balanced by white lily floral and basil herbal hop notes with a touch of lemony bitterness make for one sick combo. T- malty sweet, honey and butter, light grains, apple, pear, white grape, reisling, touch of grassy hop flavor is working against the sweet. hard to call it bitter per se, as the bitterness is more expressed in subtle hop flavor- this one showcases malt with hops merely as an accent. all sorts of cereal grain flavors like the sweet little morsels of meusli, bran, rice, barley, oat, and wheat all wrapped up into a cereal bar of a beer with enough flora; and herbal hop bitterness and flavor to keep things under a sublime awning of balance. finishes sweet, dry, hoppy (NOT bitter) and yeasty with a touch of banana. heavenly. MF- as expected. i mean, after all, we're dealing with reinheitsgebot ass shit and that demands a certain aire of character... nay, a certain guarantee of quality that is-- as it were, encompassing the entire meaning of ingredientiality. respecting the german purity law as i do, i cannot help but be engaged in the balance, the very sincere simplicity of barley and hops and yeast and water that make this beer so great. D- unashamed, and upon ayinger's nutsack, i plege my allegiance to this brewery. if i ever find myself myself in germany i would probably fall to my knees. drinkability is beyond compare and i glorify this brew as such. hands down my favorite brewery and another stellar offering to hit on par with oktoberfest, weiss, and dunkel. many thanks.",4.88,Ayinger Jahrhundert Bier,European Export / Dortmunder

Has a clean, white 1 finger head after the pour, but it doesn't stick around for very long. The appearance is the only thing that I find average on this beer. The smell holds little back: sweet, earthy hops right up front, but the malts get in there too. The same could be said for that first swig of it: more hops than it would lead you to believe right up front, but a really nice malty backbone that a lot of beers with this much hops seem to leave out. In fact, the balance on this one is really spot-on. The mouthfeel is a little thicker than your typical pale, with medium, foamy carbonation, but this beer is really very drinkable. I think the mouthfeel is really where it excels. Overall, this is my favorite standard pale ale.

243,mclem06,"Out of the beers that are not extremely hard to find, this is what normally starts my night off at the local establishment. Specialty beers are normally not my cup of tea but this one is a must try if you haven't already. Instead of hops the Scottish brewed beer back in the day with Spruce and Pine so it is very different than a hop brew. The flavors come together for a heavier sweeter malt with a light fruit finish leaving a wonderful aroma and taste on the palet. It's a perfect start to the night, goes down extremely smooth and is delicious. My mouth is watering for one right now!! I only gave it a 4.5 on drinkability, mouthfeel and appearance and not 5's because modestly i have not had a beer that I would give all 5's to.

266,ommegangpbr,"I was at a local deli looking for something I hadn't had before and found this critter. The green bottle, the screw tops, and the claim that it's the world's number one selling Indian lager didnt scare me off. This was a pleasant surprise. One of the best macro lagers I've had to date. Drinks very much like a good pilsner (mind you, I'd rather have a good pilsner but this makes for a fair to fine substitute). Pours golden with a bright white head that actually hangs around for more than 10 seconds. None-too terrible lacing for a macro. Fresh hop and citrus scent. A hint of malt, a hint of yeast and grass. A tinge metallic but no skunk or corn or rice or pee. Excellent while very cold and not at all offensive as it warms. This makes me think of how I learned to like beer when offerings were slim. This has that really nice hops bite that you find in some pilsners and lagers... like fresh Heinekan or Grolsch... shades of Prima Pils, maybe. By no means should you go out of your way to find this. It's in a green bottle and there's no freshness date to be found.. but it IS brewed in New York state so it's probably safer than many euro lagers regarding freshness and quality control.

Finish is just a twinge of hoppy citrus that balances well with the malt character of the beer.

307,AnalogReigns,"Koelsch is best drank at celler (50F) temperature, not ice cold. A: A beautiful beer, pours perfectly into a Koelsch glass, with a tall fluffy long lasting head (always a sign of a good German style beer). Light bright golden color, no cloudiness at all. S: Noble hops apparent in the smell, with some floral notes, as is typical of this style, as tasted in Cologne. T: This really is an excellent version of the classic Koelsch style. Slightly sweet very well ballenced, with a solid hop finish--and a very nice bread-like aftertaste. One can taste a very subtle kind of hint of cherry from the ale-temp fermentation (NO cherry flavor added thank you!) . M: Full but not thick...and very refreshing on the palate. A great alternative to weiss beers, in my opinion. D: Summer beer brings out the girly beers....and of course lots of weissens. This is a beer you can drink in the finest company--as it really is a delicate wonderfully tasting, the fussiest wine drinker may like it... but its not a trendy wheat beer either, and even bud drinkers will like it, I'd wager. This kind of beer could well turn a beer-philistine into a true beer-geek connoisseur. I spent a few days in Cologne last year, and sampled several brands of Koelsch there (and brought a Stange glass home). Koelsch is a tremendously tastey and rare style--and it's amazing how fast the Koelners can drink them, and serve them! This is the closest I've had in North America to what you get there. Koelsch is a very delicate beer, and spoils quickly, so even the German brands available on tap I've had in the USA don't taste as authentically Koeln-ish as Harpoon.

One of the most pleasant beers out there, it has a bold full flavor that is smokey and sweet. It bestows a smooth crisp mouth feel, and leaves only a little sweet aftertaste. It goes well with most meat based dishes, especially if they have a slight spice to them, and with its sweet smokey taste, it makes a wonderful warming beer for the chillier winter months."" But i would like to add a few things, I wasn't expecting it, but the greatest part came right after pouring this into an ice cold pint glass,that was the sweet aroma it bestowed me before I enjoyed it. It was delightful, I could smell complex array of coffee tones, hint of mocha, the robust sent of a bold porter, all of the above. Its be far on of the most pleasing beers to smell. I addition to the last review, I noticed on thing, I wont disagree with but would care to expand. It is a 'wonderful warming beer for the chillier winter months,' clear that was written in February 08, a very wintery month, however I discovered and first came to love this beer after having it chilled to the core, in the middle of summer, after working on a hot day.

S- very nice citrus and tropical fruit. canned mandarin orange, peach, pear, apricot, plum, strawberry, honeydew melon, banana, mango, papaya, and some lemon candy. since this beer isn't spiced i'm gonna assume that all or most of these aromas are coming from the yeast which i find to be very impressive. a solid pale wheat aroma stands tough behind the fruitiness with just a touch of very floral noble hops. T- a bit grainier in flavor than the aroma, the fruit doesn't translate over to the taste but there's still a definite tropical hint constantly laying semi-exposed in the background. most of what comes out is in the citrus category, namely lemon & orange peel, with flowering herbs, rose petals, dry triple sec, and a definite foundation of pale wheat and barley with fleeting apricot, plum and orange blossom in the finish. very clean and unoffensive taste overall, and i feel gladdened after nearly burning myself out on wheat beers this summer. MF- sturdily bodied while being an absolute refresher, its apparent that this brew is generously malted. very juicy feeling, like fermenting OJ, but prickly medium high carbonation breaks things up and is the perfect fit for a beer of this consistency. finishes slightly dry and cleansing. D- a knockout of an APWA, a single that i almost didn't buy, and another example of my foolish underestimation. suited to my tastes, this is without a doubt the best APWA i've ever had ever.",4.77,Blue Star Great American Wheat Beer,American Pale Wheat Ale

434,DangerousDanBrewery,"This is just possibly my favorite brew of all time. Besides buying it in stores, my brother and I would make the 1-hour drive up to the brewery anytime he visited me in Vermont. When I left Vermont I had 6 empty Otter Creek Growler bottles. Very sad that they discontinued this beer as it was by far the best they have made. First thing you notice is a nice slightly cream-colored head and a welcoming copper color. Then the roasted malt and somewhat nutty aroma draws you in. It has a very distinctive aroma from the Tettnanger hops used as aroma hops and for dry hopping. The taste, as you might guess is very hoppy to begin with, but just about the time the hops are about to get overwhelming, the malt flavors blossom and smooth it all out. This is a really nicely balanced brew. Finish is fairly dry with a slight lingering sweetness that makes you want to open another.

438,JudgeRoughneck,"2008 Vintage Sampled August 29 2012. Appearance- Jet back with a copper-colored head with a texture like velour. It only gives a thin surface cap but hangs around the edges of the glass waiting to reclaim thick legs that take entire minutes to fall. Opaque. Aroma- sweet dried fruit, very vinous, suggestive of a brett character... getting chills and visitations from memories of thomas hardys. Flowery, earthy, leathery. Center of the aroma is well-fermented molasses, sour cherrys, faint metallic odor, baking bread, hint of ash, ..definitely some funk running up in here. I could smell this forever. Flavor- Wow. Where to start? A little sour as anticipated, but grounded in a deep, rich, dark syrupy malt base with peppery alcohol dropping the bottom out for a roasty finish. Flavors and sensations pass in waves. Notes of baked apple and fig. Just bitter enough. Lovely fennel/ caraway dimension. Candied plum coming out with warmth. Chocolate-covered strawberries. At times begins to impersonate a well-aged fruit forward / jammy red wine. Hey rides into the sinuses. A little nut and mocha coming out in the finish. Amazingly the classic stout points of roast, chocolate, coffee, etc are basically the last thing I notice when drinking this beer. That stuff is really mellow and there is just so much else going on. Mouthfeel - This beer makes love to my mouth. It is velvety, creamy, heavy, smooth, fluffy, oily, full-bodied, all at the same time. Carbonation is on the low side but certainly present even at this age. There is virtually nothing bracing going on at all. Smooth all the way down. Sourness and alcohol only tease the palate and tickle the senses making me want to keep this beer in my mouth as long as possible. Overall - I don't know what to say. My mind is totally blown. I feel guilty I opened this without other people around. Why does nobody talk about this beer? It is literally the awesomest thing I have drank in my life. Why does this beer not have a higher score? Fine by me, I'll be buying it up every chance I get. Unknown Vintage - Purchased recently - sampled 2018 Appearance - Jet black, thick meniscus but no real legs, thin suede colored head fades quickly and them vanishes altogether, Aroma - dried cherry and new leather, medium low-herbal hop, bright lactic character below the surface, pumpernickel bread, hints of charcoal and anise, bitter chocolate, all very well melded and teasing. maybe a little papery, no apparent alcohol Flavor - Can definitely tell this is a younger bottle than the one I reviewed above, but all the elements are still there. high but extremely pleasant roast character slices through high malt sweetness (golden promise?) is deepened on the palate by the soft lactic element and then a long, sticky, bitter, funky finish with just a hint of warmth on the tip of the tongue. High level of herbal hop flavor with black currant, in finish. High level bitterness comes off as bitter chocolate. pine notes, a little woody, rhubarb, some blueberry notes. fig notes, dried cherry, Get Low levels of leather, horse, hey in finish. Extremely nice. Doesn't exactly seems estery though it is very fruity, no trace of D. Extremely vinous and actually does drink like a red wine (pinot / Malbec) at times. Not getting the oxidation I thought I got in the aroma. MF - Very little carbonation but the roast and acidity give it great structure, full bodied, a little sticky/syrupy, slight alcohol tingle Overall - always wondered if that first bottle was a fluke, but I don't think so, still complex and awesome, though clearly some age might allow it to develop further.

560,Offa,"To me, beer just can't get better than this. It's a clear, deep red-amber with a thick, dense light tan, permanent head that leaves thick lacing in layers down the glass. The aroma is strong and thickly aromatic, toffee, fruity and with citrusy hops. The taste, on the sweet side but nicely balanced with a hoppy bite, has elements of caramel, fruit, very floral hops with a bite, light citrus, and a hint of cinnamon and spice that lingers faintly in the aftertaste. It is wonderfully rich and complex while being incredibly balanced, drinkable, and smooth.",5.0,Fuller's 1845,English Strong Ale

S- Toasted oats, light caramel, soft candied fruit T- It just tastes like the beer I've been searching for. It is not too dark in flavor like more toasted octoberfests, and it is not wimpy-weak straw tasting like a pale ale or lager.

It was refreshingly sweet, and easy to drink. Mouthfeel: I felt that it had a light mouthfeel due to the fruity flavors and carbonation, but also a slightly full mouthfeel as well due to it's sweet finish. It had low-medium carbonation.

If you have never had a true Belgian kriek, you are missing out. This is nothing like this fruity flavored beers that US craft brewers try to make. This is a true Belgian beer. Aged for years, kriek beer is specially brewed with aged hops(not for flavor ) but for preservation. This is a great beer to enjoy with your favorite woman.

Aroma - You can smell the flavors as you open the beer, medium malt and pumpkin nose with a bit of spice. If you love pumpkin, the aroma won't disappoint you. Taste - The taste follows the aroma, it really enhances it quite a bit, makes for a perfect combination between smell and taste. Mouthfeel - It is a medium body feel with perfect carbonation.

Ultimatly, Its very Smokey with that Chocolate covered raisin fruitiness. Maybe Chocolate covered Cherry as well. I can't find much coffee-like flavors at all. There is very little hop bitterness to speak of. The Roasted Malt makes up most of what you taste. To generalize, its Bitter-sweet. The feel is medium on the palette, Its not really creamy however, it is very rich and sits on your stomach like you've just had a meal.

It had a decent look to it, not the best I've ever seen but pretty respectable. It had a nice medium brown color, I guess kind of amber. It was a bit fizzy but not too much. I don't like a lot of fizz, but to each their own for those who do. The taste was great! Not too hoppy, which is good for me, and it had a good caramel taste that I thought was present. Taste-wise, I am sure there are much bolder flavored beers out there, but this one doesn't lack flavor and is all in all very good.

694,Bayern1971,"Best beer in North America and up there with the Belgian greats like Tripel Karmeliet. Though La Fin du Monde gets all the attention from Unibroue, Donde is somehow better. I've never seen Donde on tap anywhere (why not???) so from a bottle it must be served. Smell is a complex aroma of fine yeast, dark fruit and sweet malt. Pours like a weiss beer with little head and lacing. The appearance is a deep, golden bronze that's a bit cloudy, almost like a German Weizenbock. And to that end, I think this one should really be classified as a Weizenbock as it's looks and tastes like a really intense weissbier. The bottle says it's triple wheat and I believe them. Taste is a bright explosion of fruit, clove and a sweet caramel. Finish is smooth as water off a duck's ass. Alcohol is well hidden as it's 9% and there's not much tang from the fermentation. Begs to be savoured and enjoyed slowly. This is a celebration beer and a good alternative to any wine you my enjoy. Unibroue is so far ahead of its North American competition, it's painful for their challengers.

I have been a fan of everything I have tried that has come out of this brewery and was hoping they could continue to roll along for me with a light brown ale. This one poured a very nice hazelnut brown with about two inches or so of off white head. This gradually faded and left behind nothing more then a token bit of lace on top and some nice and delicate side glass lace. You could see some carbonation trickling up from the bottom letting you know it was alive. The smell was quite light, sharp, and surprisingly hoppy. Nice grainy and earthy base gave way to a bit of sugar and caramel and a touch of some light floral hops. The taste followed suit very nicely. Start out with a touch of caramel and then quickly rolled into a very nice sharp grapefruit like hops. Great dry finish really kept the whole package going. Great feel on this one, nice smooth, medium to light body was kept up by ample carbonation throughout. This was a good one that you could have a few of over the course of the night, as there was definitely nothing boring going on here. Overall I was very impressed with this one again. It was a nice light, sweet brown ale that had just enough of a hop kick to satisfy someone like myself.

Better than the current trend of psychedelic art you see with other craft beer brands. Smell is wonderful and pleasant, with aromas of bright tropical fruit with a lot of floral hints. You get a underlying toast and some depth. The taste is much the same as the aroma. Very hop forward with bright citrus notes. Taste is guava, and apricot fruit with a floral kiss. The malt lies underneath the fruitiness of this ale. The feel is nothing out of the ordinary. The hop residue stays with you for a while. I highly recommend you give this beer a try.

On the nose it is, in the words of another reviewer, ""like Scottish food"" - lots of spice, malt, esters, vinegar, tartness, and plum. On the palate it is extremely complex and enjoyable - sweet & sour with a fair balance between the two: not too sweet, not too sour. The finish snaps sour with a hint of bing cherry. Pair with: carrot-miso soup with sesame oil (I'm not even kidding), herbed goat cheese, baked brie with fruit, dates and figs, roast duck, or venison with cherry sauce.

A tall, melting frame of mousse settled down efficiently allowing me to bring it to my nose. The aromas were subtle and deep with resonant, bass earth notes dominant while allowing for a suggestion of nectar to spiral upward. But this isn't necessarily a beer for smelling. It's for serving cool and letting the liquid warm up in the mouth while it releases a gorgeous alpine incense of sun-baked grasses, plump storage grains and pressed flowers. Subtle, but enchanting...and emminently drinkable. Here's the test: As the drink gets warmer the balance seems even more sure. And the finish! every sip begs to be followed by another. A natural puzzle of lilting, serene deliciousness wants me to solve it! Another sip. Now a generous drag from the glass. That's great lager man!

944,mikesgroove,"A  Ok now this was a serious looking brew. Poured a very hazy, so cloudy you could not even see through it, pale golden yellow. Tons and tons of sediment were apparent right from the beginning, swirling around in the glass and eventually coming to rest near the bottom. A large two inch head of sticky and foamy lace formed on the top and had great retention, lasting for almost a good few minutes before settling back down to earth and remaining at about a half an inch throughout the remainder of the session. A large amount of side glass lace was present and pretty much obscured the contents throughout. This was far and away the best looking pale ale I have ever seen. This just looked great in every way and earns a perfect 5 in look hands down. S  The aroma was awesome. First thing I noticed was a sharp dose of citrus hops, however they were not so bitter, but rather sweet and floral with a very pleasing overall aura about it. Large amounts of yeast were also present and gave it a rather light, fruity feel. Small doeses of apples, appears and even some peaches were apparent as was a slightly fresh cut grass of sort. Very nice aroma and to be honest this just is not seeming like a pale ale to me. T  Wow, what the crap is this. This is just fantastic. A huge full robust flavor just overwhelmed the taste buds from the first moment I sipped this. I was really blown away by the depth in the flavor here. Lots of floral hops, but not overbearing, kinda muted on the bitterness and replaced with more of a sugary sweetness. Lots of yeast in the flavor as well. Nice fruity flavors, but very light and full of apples and pears. A good backbone of light grain malts was present and really helped push everything else to the front. There was a touch of some lemon almost, something with a bit of a twang and very bright. That is the best way I can describe this one, very bright. It was honestly one of the best all around flavors I have ever had. Pretty much perfect. M  Very full bodied. Lots of carbonation that hung around until the bitter end. This really helped to solidify the overall lively feeling of this. It had such a unique feel. On one had it was light in body, full of carbonation and had a nice crisp cut off, however it was still rather filling and had a definite presence to it. Very complex, but exceptionally good. I really cannot say anything bad here at all and yet another score of 5. D  Now here, hands down this is a five. It was beyond sessionable. Truly a fantasic crafted brew. I could have had another and another and another. I just do not have words to accurately describe it. All of this packed into 4%abv? I just dont see how. If I could I would buy a case and make sure it was in the fridge at all times, it was just that good. Overall this has to be one of the best brews I have ever had. Just a complete package of sessionability and by far the best session ale I have ever had. I cannot compare it to anything else as it was just that good.

1002,futureman69,"Ok, ok....you guys (and gals) are looking at my ratings and thinking ""how could this brew possibly be as good as he claims..?""...well, there are a few things you need to know first: 1) You need to be a Helles Lager fan 2) See item #1... 3) You get the picture. Helles lager is a VERY exclusive beer club; it's definitely NOT for the faint of heart or for the hop-enthuiast. Helles-style lager has its own beer-aesthetic - and not one that can be easily explained - but let's just say I live within 45 minutes of the Victory brewery in wonderful Amish-laden Pennsylvania and I can say with utmost confidence that - straight out of the tap or the bottle - this IS the most delicious example of this variety of beer I have ever had. Do yourself a favor: try it. If you don't like, set it aside and don't think about it for several months... Then pick it up again - give it another try. If it still doesn't appeal to you, set it aside. Talk with friends. Play pinball. Shoot skeet...take a walk. THEN - come back and drink it again. Ok...""Wow!"", you'll say...or ""huh.."" or something. Ok. At this point, change your life. Go back to school and get that post-graduate degree. Or, maybe, propose to that high-school sweetheart and finally get married and settle down. Something. SOMETHING! Do something with your liffe, Goddam-itt! Then, after you've changed, come back and try Victory Lager again. Perhaps you will have found a place for it in your life - at last. Perhaps not. Ok, several more decades have past; the family's good, the kids are grown, the wife's got some 'growing pains'...says she wants to try life on her own for a while - out in the Pacific Northwest - without you - so you let her go...you trade in your stocks, sell the homestead, flip over your long-held socio-political ideology and find life anew as an ascetic new-millenium warrior monk. God bless you! Now, go to your local beer retailer and purchase a fresh case of Victory Lager. Chill it. Open it. Sip it. Savor it.

1008,jifigz,"Ok, I have had this beer since the fall when I picked up a case of this at Raystown Beverage in Huntingdon, Pa. This has been the sole survivor to see how this beer aged. Bottle poured into a standard pint glass. A: Even with an extremely gentle pour the head on this beer was huge. It was several inches high and lingered for a long time leaving beautiful lacing all over the glass. I could only fit about 2/3 on the first amount of the pour. The color is hazy amber orange/brown with a ton of sediment. S: Very fruity esters in the nose. Smells like a mixture or raisins and flowers. Reminiscent of a La Fin Du Monde. T: Delicious. The beer is spiced rather well. The raisin/fruity flavors pull through with a slight sour/bitterness. The higher level of alcohol has a warming effect on the palate and throat. M: The mouthfeel on this one is perfect. Creamy and warm, and extremely effervescent (maybe that could be perceived as a downfall). O: This is certainly one of my favorite beers.

1009,pmcadamis,"A - A cascade effect builds up a gloriously chunky 4 finger orangish hued head over a dirty, murky, redish-orangish-brown brew. Looks viscous and thick. Lots of orangish lace is left on the glass. S - Milk chocolate, chocolate cake, scones with caramel oozing over them. Also dates, prunes, toffee, and rum. This is wonderful! T - Just about the richest brew ever. Full of hearty whole grain bread, german chocolate cake, fruitcake, scones, and everything that is thick chewy, moist, and drizzled in honey and caramel. Towards the end of the sip, big grassy hops come out to play and keep all of that cakey sweetness in check. Actually the sweetness never gets out of hand at any time due to the thick bready grainy malt characteristics that are more akin to biscuits with honey drizzled on top rather than pure candy sweetness. M - Just about the thickest, most viscous beer I've ever put in my mouth! Chewy, thick, slick and creamy at first, but then moving toward a dry and sandy finish. Excellent! D - Damn the alcohol content. I would session the hell out of this stuff. This is right up there with Okocim Porter for my favorite brew so far.",5.0,Old Horizontal,American Barleywine

It pairs well with Victory's signature Bavarian style pretzel, if you are lucky enough to be enjoying it at the brewery. I stumbled upon a random 6-pack of this beer in April, against my better judgement (knowing it had probably been sitting on the shelf since the fall) I bought it anyway.

1079,AtlasBrew,"Color: A gorgeous amber color with an off white fluffy head that stays for awhile and leaves lacy rings as it slowly fades. Crystal clear! Aroma: Fruity and a bit floral with just a hint of spice and steely-ness (if that is a word, I don't think it is.) There is a very faint hint of caramel also. It's a lovely aroma. Taste: A mildly sweet caramel flavor up front that melds ever so gently into a spicy, fruity flavor in the middle. A mild steely bitterness greets you at the exit door and bids you farewell with a pleasant semi-dry finish. Overall: I've tried many Pale Ales in the past several years. Some are overly caramel flavored, some try to mask there poor quality with large doses of dry-hopping. Some just miss entirely. But, I can tell you this; I have not had a better Pale Ale than Shelter Pale. It is a fantastic example of what a session-able Pale Ale should be.

The blind purchase was made under the guise of both my love of stouts and Berkshire Brewing. Boom and boom on both counts! I'll skip the details, because this is an imperial stout, so the profile isn't far from what you would expect. In brief, it is black, malty, roasted, boozy, and just downright delicious. It is not the individual details of this ale, but rather the sum of its characteristics that make this a real stout lover's dream. The one unique flavor here is the slight ""fresh"" coffee flavor, that nobody does better than Berkshire, IMO. This is easily the best imperial stout I have ever had, and one of the tastiest stouts overalll. Don't hesitate to grab one.

Desirable yeast aroma is present along with caramel, both sweet and sour apples, pear, banana, lemongrass and spices. Taste - velvety and bready Belgian yeast and malt. Tart and tropical fruits, lemony hints. Spicy phenolic characteristics as well as a definite bitter hop presence. Honey, although not nearly as sweet as the aroma may have suggested. This beer really coats the mouth well and the finish is somewhat dry. Some Belgians are borderline cloyingly sweet with no other complexities - not so at all with this masterpiece.

Initial sips reveal coffee and malt roastiness, dark chocolate, and a not over the top hoppiness. Retro-nasal reveals more of the anise and dark fruit (plum) characteristics of the beer.

1169,SaintPeter,"Poured in Imperial Pint glass(as bottle told me to), bottled on 12/8/08, Rev. 7/3/09 Pours a dark coca cola color with a huge three finger light brown head that disintegrates with an exciting show of lacing leaving a spattering of cling on the glass. Mildy carbonated. The head returns when swirled and the carbonation disappears. The robust aroma is a wonderful combination of rustic and sweet bread, caramel, toffee, malt, leche de cajeta, flan with a touch of black licorice, treacle, oak cappaccino coffee. This is the most wonderful brown ale I have ever had the pleasure of inhaling. WOW! The taste is similar to the aroma, a deep malty sweetness of honey, oats and chocolate engulfs your mouth then the mellowing slightly bitterness sets in balancing the beer to the maximumer, touches of oak, black licorice, tamarind, caramel. Finishes chocolatey, somewhat sweet and malty. Wonderful, completely wonderful! An impressive mouthfeel, like a silky chewy slice of heaven. Full bodied, rich and chewy like bubble gum. It just gets fuller as you swirl it around in your mouth. Phenomenal! Ultra drinkable, ultra balanced. Try this even if it is at the Chicago Airport for $7 buck a pint, it is worth it. This is probably one of the best beers I have ever set lips to. If there ever was a perfect beer, this is it. If I lived in Illinois, I would drink this all the time and I am not sure I could go back to the somewhat good beers. This is a connoisseur's beer. I can't give enough praise for it.

The rich, grainy malt base holds its own compared with traditional brews of Europe. The hopping at 34 IBUs is plenty firm but, because the hops are noble English varieties — East Kent Goldings and Fuggles — one speaks in this case, not of ""balance"" or ""harmony,"" but of seamless integration with the malt. Being a revival of a 19th-century St Louis recipe, it would be inapt to judge this beer by the evolving standards of post-1980 APAs, much less IPAs. For the focus isn't on hops as such, it's about a totality that's more than the parts.

1276,Americanlagerisbest,"Coors is my personal favorite beer. Since turning 21 about 2 years ago I have bought and consumed gallons upon gallons of this stuff. Why do I like it so much? An ice cold Coors tastes like the perfect beer, there is nothing fancy about it, it needs no gimmick relating to taste like so many craft or ""trendy"" beers rely on. It is simply a beer, a pale colored American style lager with a 5% alcohol content to boot. Whether you are out working on a hot July day, wrenching in a freezing cold garage in January, or simply enjoying one with a fine meal a Coors always accompanies any situation perfectly. It smells delicious, one whiff of one and I am eager to consume it. It goes down smooth, and as I mentioned it tastes incredible, whether you are enjoying it in a can or in one of the retro style stubby bottles. I enjoy this beer year round, any time day or night. Some say Coors' popularity comes from the perceived forbidden qualities of it's past. This beer was illegal East of the Mississippi river until the 1980's due to the alcohol content. However it has always had a huge following, not just in the Western United States. Keith Richards loved Coors, and would have it flown in wherever the Stones were touring. President Eisenhower would have Coors flown in to enjoy with dinner at the White House. Cases were smuggled East back in the day and sold for 3x their actual cost, which of course inspired the classic film Smokey and the Bandit. My own Grandfather who was a long haul trucker in the 70's would smuggle Coors back in the door panel of his Kenworth to drink when he got back home. Nowadays people like Sam Elliot represent Coors marketing. I think this is the perfect beer, because it has outstanding quality for a mass produced beer. The impressive cultural impact of Coors is only matched by it's rich history. This Beer has been brewed the same way from Rocky Mountain Water since 1873, the same year that we got Levi Strauss and Colt's Single Action Army Revolver. The ""Banquet"" name is inspired by the miners who would come into town after a hard days work and enjoy Mr. Coors beer in the drinking establishments in Golden Co. In conclusion, whether you are a rock star, a hardworking blue collar American, or the leader of the free world, this beer does not discriminate. Folks from all backgrounds and all walks of life have been enjoying this beer for close to 150 years, and will still be enjoying it into the foreseeable future.",5.0,Coors Banquet,American Adjunct Lager

Fairly good carbonation, enough to sting the tongue just a bit. Tiny streams of bubbles keep the head going. The color is a very rich chestnut brown, but clear enough to still see through. The first impressions of the taste are a very mellow malt, then opening up into a lively pallet of nutty caramel and a hint of citrus. This stuff is unbelievable, without a doubt one of a kind!

1441,Offa,"This is one of my all-time favourite beers and for me beer dosn't get any better than this overall. It is beautiful, a faintly murky, dark red-brown with a big, creamy, permanent light tan head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is rich fruit, bread, caramel, over a lightly alcoholic body. The taste is similar with stewed, caramelized fruit, caramel, toast, and nuts. It has a stroing sweetness balanced with a light spicey bitterness and toastiness. It is rich, beautifully balanced, with the flavours blending nicely, giving lots of flavour and well-roundedness but maintaining immense drinkability. The feel is smooth and a little oily but not too heavy. In the end, it has the rich flavours of a barleywine yet is exceedingly smooth and easy to drink. It also is not too alcoholic in taste, which I find sometimes to be a problem.",5.0,Young's Old Nick Barley Wine Ale,British Barleywine
1443,LLP,"Yes, this gets a perfect score. This brew is in a very elite class. Why? Allow me to explain. My wife and I have conducted double-blind taste tests over the past 5 years of every Stout (we always compare beers of the same basic style; plain Stout, Oatmeal, Imperial, Coffee, Chocolate or Cream/Milk Stouts) we could get our hands on (about 50 or so now) and Steelhead has come out the victor every single round! This is an extremely unique, thick, full-bodied, rich Stout the way a Stout should be. When one decants a Steelhead, a thick layer of goodness can be seen on the bottom of each bottle. We have found that the beer becomes even more complex (if such a thing could be possible given the unbelieveable depth of this brew) if we decant 11 oz. then swirl the final ounce around to loosen the sediment before pouring the last bit. This also serves to create a beautiful thick, rich, dark brown head.",5.0,Redwood Stout,American Stout

1504,doppelmeup,"Wow. This is my first perfect ranking ever. I'm not even sure what to write in my review. Poured from a 500ml bottle into a pint glass. No freshness dating on the bottle. Deep, deep brown colored brew with little light seeping through. A rich, A&W Rootbeer-like head resolves to a thick, creamy layer of foam. Decent lacing throughout the glassful. Aromas of sweet malt, brown sugar, toffee. Flavors mimic aroma, and this is exceptionally smooth. Malty, slightly sweet to start with, and then just enough hop bitterness to cleanse the palate. Only the slightest hint of alcohol comes through as the beer warms. I've never tasted a beer this smooth or creamy and as perfectly balanced as this. Exceptional!! Mouthfeel is extraordinary. Rich, creamy, velvety, with a clean finish. Is there even any alcohol in this? I'd never believe it. And it's over 8%? No way. This is too smooth and creamy. I could drink this all night. It is the best beer I've ever had!!! As I mentioned above, this is the first perfect 5 rating I've ever given a beer, and this one truly deserves it. Wow!

1550,Zaradog,"Visual: Served in a pint glass, rendered a nearly white one finger head that dissipated to a thin film within a minute. It has a slightly foggy “clover honey” color. Slight lacing left on the empty glass. Aroma: I pick up a sweet bready smell mixed with peach/orange. It you have ever had the orange sweet rolls from Pillsbury… it is kind of like those… only before you add the icing. And the citrusy hop note has a very sweet smell rather than one that smells like it will be bitter. Taste: There is a noticeable bready taste that goes a long way towards totally masking any bitterness you might expect. An ever so gentle bit of bitterness swells up in the back of your mouth and then fades leaving a fresh taste that I can’t quite describe… but I really like! Honey toast maybe… yeah, kind of like honey toast. Mouth Feel: For whatever reason, when I cracked open the cap, it started to overflow… so I lost a bit of carbonation there. This was curious though because I don’t think I did anything to cause it to foam up. Anyway, I was left with the perfect amount of carbonation for this beer. Not so much that it is hard to drink or that it makes you feel burpy… rather just enough to wake up your tongue. Again, I’m pleased. Drink-ability: I think this might possibly be my new favorite beer. I find myself taking big draws from my cup and then sitting back and allowing the beer to touch every part of my tongue. Breathe in, exhale slowly… mmmm. For me right now… This beer is perfect. I find myself wishing I had a six pack to enjoy! I could get lost in the awesomeness of this beer for hours if I only had more. Impressions: I’m left trying to remember if my local store carries this in six packs or if it was only available as a single. Is it a seasonal??? God I hope not. If it is I need to stock up. This beer is good enough that I just looked at the clock to see if I had time to drive south 40 minutes to get some more before the store closed. Unfortunately there is no time. This isn’t a strong beer, not a ton of character.

Very toasty and full-flavored with just enough hops to accentuate the malts and spices, culminating with a nice pie crust finish. The most complete pumpkin ale so far. Mouthfeel - medium body, sufficient carbonation to give it a crisp autumn feel. Drinkability - a great pumpkin ale, deserving of its following.

The smell is very fruity, with a stunning bouquet of berries, plums, grapes and a potpourri pot of spice. Pure, complex, and amazing. The taste starts off as pure strawberry, with raisin, leafy hops, some slight bitterness and soapyness (which I like) and a good dose of flowers. Very nice. I can't imagine a better flavor profile right now. Very unique, refreshing and satisfying. The mouthfeel is velvety and soft, but with a nice weight to it. A velvet hammer, if you will.

1607,yzer,"This is my first review for BA, so I should make my viewpoint known. I am pretty new to craft, micro brews and ales in general. I took an interest in ales only two years ago. It seems to me that there are two ways of evaluating an IPA. An IPA can be tasted fresh and soon after the bottling date, or it can be evaluated after six months of cellaring. I believe that the true test of any IPA must be made after a minimum of six months of bottle aging: the true test of a beer that was originally formulated to be consumed after an unrefrigerated voyage of six months duration from the British Isles to the Indian subcontinent. I enjoyed the February 2007 bottling of Sierra Nevada IPA fresh. I also enjoy another SN IPA as a fresh IPA: Celebration Ale. For this review I have notes for Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale (with the dark green schooner label) bottled 70058 (February 27, 2007). This evaluation was enjoyed in September of 2007, when the IPA was six months old. It was cellared without refrigeration in my garage stored dark and covered in a cool northern corner on slab concrete. SN India Pale Ale is poured into a glass stein. Aroma is hoppy, fruity and pungent without the slightest trace of skunking. A raisin scent is noticed immediately. The head is quick to form, modest in height, dense, sandy off-white in color and laces well. Carbonation is lively and long lasting. The color is dark amber with burnished gold highlights. This IPA poured with a medium clarity owing to suspended yeast that accumulated on the bottom ½ inch of the bottle during six months of aging. Plenty of yeast stayed put on the bottom of the bottle. The taste displayed a sharp but not overly powerful hops bite that lingered as the predominant aftertaste. The malt and fruitiness of the Goldings hops combined harmoniously as only single hop ale can: toasty, mellow malt with depth and a rich caramelized sweetness. The dark raisin and toffee taste was a welcome surprise. Substantial, but medium feel in the mouth but refreshing. Not bad in the summer. Robust hops bitterness aside: this is the sweetest IPA I have yet to taste. Ill offer another review of this ale in March 2008, after the brew has bottle aged for a year. Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale is a beautifully balanced bottled IPA. Im asking the brewery to do another bottled run in February 2008. I hope they listen. Pack it in 12-pack boxes so we can lay it up for six months or more. Im looking forward to tasting SN Celebration Ale late this summer. Ive laid up several 12-packs low in the boat so they will be ready to enjoy at anchor in the heat of August.",4.92,Sierra Nevada India Pale Ale,English India Pale Ale (IPA)

1768,robmorris31,"BLUF: It's like drinking Christmas! The absolute and I say again the ABSOLUTE BEST regionally distributed WINTER ALE on the market period from the Alaskan Brewing Company: Style English Olde Ale. Traditionally malty with the warming sensation of alcohol, Olde Ales are brewed in the fall as winter warmers. Flavor Brewed in the style of an English Olde Ale, this ale balances the sweet heady aroma of spruce tips with the clean crisp finish of noble hops. Its malty richness is complemented by the warming sensation of alcohol. History From the seafaring adventurers of the 1700s to the homebrewers of today, adding spruce tips to beer has a rich history in Southeast Alaska. Alaskan Winter Ale was first released by the Brewery in 2000. Ingrediients Alaskan Winter is made from glacier-fed water, Sitka spruce tips and a generous blend of the finest quality European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and specialty malts. Our water originates in the 1,500-square-mile Juneau Ice Field and from the more than 90 inches of rainfall we receive each year. Recommendations Perfect winter warmer by the fireside or an accompaniment to holiday fare. Serve with roast goose, turkey, ham or lamb. A nice complement to holiday breads, pound cake, or apple pie. Story Throughout Southeast Alaska, bald eagles can be spotted landing atop the towering old growth forests of Sitka spruce trees. As many as 3,000 bald eagles congregate among these evergreen trees on the shores of the Chilkat River for the last large run of salmon before winter. Sitka spruce trees carry a significance of their own to local Alaskans. The tender new growth of the spruce tips lends a delicious, yet subtly sweet floral aroma to teas, jelly and now our Alaskan Winter Ale.",5.0,Alaskan Winter Ale,English Old Ale

S: robust malts turn into a sweeter caramel and hazelnut. Accompanied by figs, dates, prunes, apples and a healthy dose of earthy leather. T: more mellowed out than the nose but still quite nice! Caramel and apples greet the tongue with a healthy sweet biscuit. Dark dried fruits and a bit of an orange quality that hangs in the mouth. MF: medium body and full of flavor. Not too filling, and I just now noticed there is no hint of alcohol (though with 6.7% there shouldn't be).

There was a grassy hop aroma that was unquestionably present, giving you the notion that it was taste the same; however, true to style it, does not. This beer tasted great. It had a mild hop taste balanced with a noticeable malt backbone. Basically, quite contradictory to the aroma. It was extremely smooth with subtle carbonation and the malt finish was extended here. This definitely came across as a British style which was highly drinkable without the hop bite. It was terrifically balanced.

Smells incredible, as a sweetish stout should, with a LOT of chocolate, oats, roasty and a little burnt, and some strawberry esters. Tastes very interesting, with the rye adding an acidity and certain ""twang"" to the otherwise pretty simple malt profile. There is definitely a little sourness present, which I love. A bit of higher alcohols, that fluffy Bell's yeast character. I found similarities in the yeast characters of this beer with those of Westy 12. Feel is very full-bodied. From the flavor and feel I would guess 8% alc. but the web site says 6.7%. Got almost TOO creamy when it warmed.

This beer is easy to drink because it is sweet, but not too sweet and complex without being overbearing. This is a medium bodied beer that is smooth and creamy in the mouth. The carbonation grabs the tongue in the finish treating the mouth to a full on assault of texture. This is a great beer.

2231,BigB415,2009 batch received as an extra in a trade. Poured copper brown into my pint glass. At first smell I can smell alcohol and hops. I take a sip and to me it tasted like an IPA. It is very smooth and subdued for a barleywine or for me it is since this is only my 3rd or 4th barleywine beer I have had. My last barleywine beer I had was a complete opposite experience for me. I find this beer great. It is great to sip on and enjoy since it is so smooth and there is barely no aftertaste. I was very surprised by this but I am happy I tried it. If only this was available to me where I live..,5.0,Monster Ale,British Barleywine
2232,Czequershuus,"The beer pours an almost clear mahogany, with a very large head. The aroma features brown sugar, fig, cherry, raisin, plum, caramel, banana and clove. The flavor has lots of raisin and fig, with bubblegum, clove, booze, and chocolate. The mouthfeel is rich and full, but not sticky, with foamy carbonation.

I have long loved this beer, since at least 2001 when I got to taste one fresh off the bottling line at the old brewery. Tonight is a chance to revisit this glorious beer of old and I'm impressed. It pours a copper colored slightly hazy liquid. Wonderful hop-laden aroma with lots of citrus. Flavor is much better than I remembered. I'm picking up pineapple, and spices (I'm assuming this from the rye). Nicely balanced between sweet and dry notes. Very nice and full mouthfeel with hop oil that lingers on the palate. I really like this beer. Even better than I remembered. I do think (from reading my previous review) that the key to greatness for this beer is catching it fresh. Review of 4-12-2012: AP 4.5 AR 4 F 4.5 MF 4 OA 4.5 - Average 4.35 (review is of a beer aged for 3 years) I'm amazed I haven't reviewed this beer before, especially because I've drank it straight off the line (about 10 years ago while visiting the brewery at their old location) and have had many time since. Nevertheless, I discovered a very old bottle (expiration date of 7/22/09 (old enough that is the old bottle design), so I thought, what the heck, I might as well review it for kicks. I actually like the results of the aging for this beer. The hops have died down to being in the background, so now there are lots of coppery notes and lots of malt. Nice bready aroma. Mouthfeel is medium. And lots and lots of rye (the best part). It tastes like rye bread, for real. I like this beer aged. I highly recommend it.",4.83,Full Moon Pale Rye Ale,Rye Beer

While it has a very high alcohol content the taste is not dominated by it, it enhances it. The flavors are a well blended citrus, bread and floral explosion of complexity that coats the palate is beer-gasmic awesomeness. the tastiness and flavors of spice are just amazing and perfect.

2302,Cnote_crafty_1,"Erie Brewing Company - Railbender Ale Scottish Style Ale 6.8% ABV. 26 IBU's Look: Light copper/orangish with a ultra thin white head. It is slightly hazey and translucent. If you put your hand behind it you will only see the a shadowy outline of your hand. Smell: Sweet caramel, sweet malty, raisins, grapes, sort of reminds me of grape wine slightly. Taste: The taste is very much in line with the smell. Sweet and malty, caramel, raisins, grape and once the alcohol hits maybe a bit of a rum flavor. Then there is a slight hop bite on the back end that is dry. Feel: The feel is not too light at all. It is smooth and milky with alot of fast carbonation. A ton of tiny bubbles. Overall: This is pretty much my definition of a good Scotch ale. I haven't had any that I like better than this one. I bought a six pack of this at the Giant Eagle in Homestead and it turned out to have gone bad. It didn't have any dates on it and I wondered why. I tried to get my money back and the lady at Giant Eagle customer service told me she couldn't give me anything for it because of P.A. liqour laws. I am pretty sure this is a load of horse manure. Anyways, I emailed the people at Erie Brewing and they fixed my up really nicely. They said Ken from Vecenie distributers would like to give me a new six pack in exchange for my skanked sixer. They did so and the new six pack had the some old taste I have come to know and love. It just goes to show Erie Brewing is good for their word and will mend any problems related to their product.

Aroma: Very aromatic! Lots of toasted malt, immediately followed by, and almost overpowered by, tons of dried stone fruit, such as raisins and prunes, as well as candied sugar, Belgian yeast, a touch of vanilla and star anise. Taste: Very, very good! Very fruity and earthy up front, imparting notes of raisins, prunes, dates and figs, along with some toasted malt, candied sugar and Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied to slightly chewy, and much more carbonated than I’m used to in Belgian beers. With an ABV of 9.0%, there is a very pleasant alcohol warmth on the palate.

Actually smells like orange flavored dough rising. Taste is fresh baked bread with malty sweet orange zest. The finish has a slight metallic twang, presumably from the can. Perhaps the most yeasty, bready witbier to date. The yeast aroma persists throughout the session while the metallic note fades into non-existence.

S - Hearty maltiness offers rich aromatics of baked bread and nuttiness followed by dry toast and a slathering of sweet caramel T - Chewy caramel cubes offer sweetness through this densely malty brew that leaves heavenly baked bread and toasted wheat and nut bread lingering on the tongue despite it's otherwise clean lagered characteristic. M - Even though the beer's heavy carbonation is seen streaming through the glass, Uff-da is ultra-smooth; almost creamy in texture, which goes perfectly with it's fuller body and clean finish that leaves light malt traces on the tongue. O - New Glarus' Dan Carey is a brewing genius, especially when it comes to German style beer, which is no surprise considering his time spent across the pond.

Top of cap: EXP 12/4/21 so I guess its pretty fresh, since its only January 2017. A very cloudy white gold color, yeastie floatie bits swirl around with the jazzy carbonation. A crystal white tower of dense foam has staying power with excellent, stick, clumpy lace. The lace has formed full rings around the glass, perfect lacing and a big ""island"" clump of dense foam perfectly centered just refuses to fall.Looong lace, very sticky and continuously carbonated and lively. A very hearty, bready and herbalized malty aroma impresses the senses. Dramatically herbal, earthy and funky hop scent is very powerful. Major tones of dry fall leaves being baked in the sharp, autumn sun, household herbal mix and spices and green, but dry herbal hops. A classic Hallertau aroma. First, the mouthfeel....absolutley exquisite. Fresh, clean, jazzy, light and then lush, full, smooth and soft going down. Classic and perfect, dry finish that lingers. Wow. Just, wow. Out-of-this-world experience. The flavor.....Where do I begin?......Belgian Golden Ale with a major hop profile. My favorite hop flavors are the classic European sort, Saaz,Hallertau and Noble. I love the dank earthy, herbal and spicy hop cone flavor's most.....and this one might be the most earthy, herbal and spicy hop taste I have ever had. It's very dense in Hallertau and Brewer's Gold flavor's. Very, very complex hop profile, with an excellent, slightly sweet, bready and wicked clean pilsner malt balance. Some of the charm to this brew is in the amazing balance of classic pilsner malty flavors and huge, earthy hop tones getting it on! Grooving, big-time. The very long, sun-baked leaves and dry earth finish is remarkable. The liquid simply dances on your pallet. Dry, golden wheat, barley and hops from a very isolated farm in the country is the vibe I get with every sip. I can picture an ancient farmer with immaculate, high elevation soil,rolling hills and field as far as the eye can see..... Plowing, tilling & sowing his fields, preparing these ingredients for some face-less Belgian or French King and his extensive kingdom. QUALITY! The King shouts. This brew would delight to no end.

2671,monkist,"I was glad to find this one from Sierra, as they are one of my favorite breweries - and I love barleywine so the joy was double. It is from 2015 so by today (2017) it is already somewhat vintage. Actually it is a barleywine-style ale the bottle says and right, it is not as syrupy as a normal barleywine would be. It is rather like a heavily hopped ale and Sierra are masters of this kind of beer. Along with heavly caramellized malts I feel loads of hops, especially perhaps bittering hops? because the aftertaste is quite bitter with quite a complexity. Very good that the body is lighter than a usual barleywine, but the remarkable taste is still there both in the nose and the feel. Makes me feel like a very very rich IPA... the richness of the hops is amazing, perhaps with Sierra's trademark Cascades? If I had to compare it to something, perhaps it is similar to the Arrogant Bastard Ale - and this should tell it all: it is amazing! An excellent beer this is, Sierra did a great job again.

Label said to 'enjoy over the next 5 years' -- 14 years was worth the wait. Poured the color of maple syrup with a thin cover of small bubbles that grew when swirled in an old Flying Dog pint glass. Very smooth and mellow, fruit like flavor, almost like a port, with a mild vanilla aftertaste. Slight alcohol smell and taste, though the 10-11% would sneak up on you. No smell of hops -- the malts and oats came through strongly with slight taste of Kent Goldings and other English hops (?) -- a fantastic example of an aged barley wine. Got better as it warmed up.

Super charged (in the words of Ronald Theriot), after a few sips it dies down so you don't get it all over your face. But you can really smell that aroma during those first few sips. If you've ever had a Blegian anything, you'll notice that familiar scent when it first hits your nose. But the aroma as a whole is earthy, grassy, there's some fruit in there... amazing. Did not expect it. Taste is phenominal. I payed for what I thought and what was priced to be a Heineken competitor, but got so much more. Can't describe it. Just go buy some and try it. Mouthfeel is crisp, refreshing, but not lacking. The flavor packs a wallop, and it is 5.4% alcohol, a tad stronger than your typical beer it is placed next to in the cooler.

Immediately upon opening the bottle it made a slight hiss then filled the air with the scent of apples. The smell changed slightly in the pour openingup notes of caramel, toffee, honey, smells as if it's going to have a very big thick flavor. Taste starts with a light bread flavor then tastes like there's mixed fruit jam on th bread- apple, raisin, plum, peach with sweet toffee candy on the end of the taste.slight alcohol aftertaste with sugars and candy lingering. The toffee caramel and sugar influence is heightened actually when the sediment is poured. It's an amber orange-brown color with bubbles rising from the bottom towards a thick head that starts 3 fingers and lowers while sipping but never goes away. More toffee and sugar flavor in the head- more bread and fruit jam taste in the liquid. An excellent drink- though I hear some people prefer a young bottle o this.

Large/small capped bottles poured into different snifters. Pitch black like most, it is capped by a thick tan head that shows very good retention and lacing. Aroma is rich, fruity, roasted, full of chocolate and coffee notes, a bit on the sweet side. The bomber version shows a bit more citric hops on the nose, feels fresher even though it is not. The full body, slightly more chewy on the bomber version, opens to a nice, well balanced roastiness with multiple chocolate, fruity and coffee notes, with no noticeable alcohol but some roasted bitterness coming and going; slightly more noticeable bitterness on the bomber version. Just like the aroma suggested, a bit on the sweet side, closer to an oatmeal stout.

Pause - Laugh insinuated Jef: (Slurp, gulp) Ahhh...Hello hops again, my oh my you are one fine and dandy hopped up beer. Your flavors aren't overly aggressive but layered in a nice complexity with wonderfully rendered resinous and floral tones that tend to bring out some very nice higher end sweet tones and woody fresh leafyness. The dryness is amazingly in control along with the bittering kept mild to my buds yet with enough grab to forward any attention that might otherwise be absent. How do you do that? B: Well, the soft caramel malts are in an abundant quanity as to balance out any real strong or abrasiveness the hops may bring. Jef: Ahhh...that's why you taste so good. Great balance with flavors on both scales weighing heavy, nice job my bottled friend. B: Why thank you. Jef: And your body seems favorable with a mediumness and some great effects of dryness with your hops. And that lingering resiny woody thing is mind boggling. I'm impressed.

Not far from where I live as this Bier speaks volumes to me. I was very impressed and look forward to reviewing their other Biers. I have tried the Dunkles before and remember it being very good but hard to find here in München. They actually sell a variety pack with all their Biers in it. Guess Ill have to pick one up soon. On to the Bier Pours up a deep dark brown mass with a fine red hue. The Bier is very clear and is topped by a very big and creamy Mocha head. From the first whiff I think I fell in love. It featured a smooth creamy malt aroma that in all my Bier life I have never encountered. Roasted Malt with Chocolate backgrounds. I can best describe this aroma by comparing it to roasting marshmallows and smelling them just at the perfect moment before they are burnt. Those seconds between perfection and trash. This one is perfection! A definite sweetness is found to round out the first impression. The sweetness is malty and also of perfectly deeply caramelized sugar. The first taste can only be described as a malt explosion! Unimaginably smooth malt character that was sweet and balanced by roast bitterness at the same time. The Bier finishes slightly dry with a beautiful lingering roasted malt flavor and bitterness. The Bier is also slightly fruity. The alcohol is present but never overly warming nor does it overwhelm any of the subtleties of this Bier. The carbonation level is low and it has a medium mouth feel.

3706,NeroFiddled,"Moylan's Ryan O'Sullivan's Imperial Stout pours a mainly black body beneath a creamy head of khaki colored foam that holds quite well and leaves solid sheets and rings of lace at the outset of the glass. Beneath the head, some mahogany highlights can be seen at the bottom of the glass; and tiny, natural (bottle conditioned) bubbles can be seen steadily rising. The nose is bready; caramelish; nutty; roasty like dark and bittersweet chocolate; lightly fruity; and it has a delicate waft of alcohol as well. In the mouth it's superbly creamy and smooth with a full body and very fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation. The bready, caramelish, and nutty maltiness appears upfront; followed by a quick note of berry-like fruitiness; and then dark chocolate and spent espresso grounds as it crosses the middle. It's got a wide flavor, and it's rich, but it's not decadent. And there's a complexity to it, but all of the flavors are easily recognizable; and it never becomes muddled on the palate. Another splash of seared dark-skinned fruit appears just before the swallow, and chocolate and coffee appear in the finish along with some dull, leafy and floral hops and a spritz of alcohol. It lingers with a dull roastiness, some mild fruit, and even some dull, spruce-like hops. This is a really well done and superbly malty (as all of the Moylan and Marin beers are) beer that has a lot of charm. It's unique in that it's supple and welcoming, with less aggressive character than most examples. All of the characteristics of the style are there, but it's just so much more accessible!

I myself have been stung far too often when trying to age beer and frequently hold on to supposedly 'age worthy' beers far too long. Having read everything online and in my library of beer books I figured four years was about the right amount of cellaring for this, the living God of old ales. Bottled in 2006 from the last ever batch to be brewed at the Horndean brewery. Removing the 4cm cork demanded some delicacy so I used a Screwpull with a thin worm (sorry, I know that sounds pretty pompous). Poured the slightly below temperature egually between two ISO glasses. Deep dark shiny mahogany and fruitcake and slight banana on the nose. Likely the richest and most seductive bouquets I have ever inhaled. The nose just goes on and on. Jesus... Seems thinnish to look at but very full on the tongue. A very slight acidity at the start which quickly falls away. There is a strong layer of sappiness there which is seamless. Everything is so perfectly integrated. On first sip a very slight woodiness before leaving a chewy element. After this it consistently ends smooth, rich and morish which is full and continues to fill out as it disappears. The beer equivalent of a naked romp with Brigitte Bardot circa 1958.

There also seems to be some acidity and tartness present. Even though it has some properities of a pale ale present (like a really nice bitterness), this brew has the smoothness of a lager. Reminds me a bit of my favorite lager, Capital's Winter Skal of 2001-2002. A little more spicy and hoppy though. This beer is classified as an APA, but I'm not so sure.

Head did diminish rather quickly to leave a coating. S - Beer had an exceptional chocolate mocha smell. Very much like many chocolate stouts. T - Doesn't take long to get a feel for the taste of this beer. It just smacks you with a heavy coffee flavor. With the smell I expected more chocolate but there is just a bit of dark chocolate taste with the coffees. M - Take one little drink of this beer and the tastes will linger for several minutes. The taste can be so strong that it is hard to distinguish a mouthfeel. I had expected a Belgian Dark Ale or some other weaker style from this but was pleasantly surprised. This is a super thick and flavorful beer. I was stunned with the smell, and then again with the flavor and loved both. One of the best beers I have discovered in a long time and very pleasant to drink.",4.97,Dark Horse Reserve Special Black Ale,American Black Ale

3916,DannyBigs,"When reviewing, it's always best to keep in mind the style of the beer. AleSmith IPA is a single IPA, at a little over 7%. That being said, I think this is the perfect single IPA, west coast style. The color is a beautiful gold, slightly hazy. Smell and taste are on point FOR THE STYLE (I find similarities with the smell of Pure Hoppiness by Alpine). Nice bitter taste, but not at all overwhelming. In my opinion, one of the best examples of the style. And now they come in dope cans, so fresh. I could crush a ton of these.",5.0,IPA,American IPA

4072,YakManDoo,Remarkable. Purchased this bottle of Salvation from my local favorite that can hardly keep it in stock. Chilled into the high 50s or so the bomber poured smooth and a cloudy golden with a bright white head reminiscent of a classic Belgian Tripel. The nose was bright and fruity with a hint of clove and a slight spiciness that showed itself in the first taste. A remarkably complex beer with a multiplicity of fruits; banana (light) berry and maybe a hint of passion fruit. The alcohol came through not so much in the taste though it was there...it was the 9.0% going straight to my head that got me. The mouthfeel was bright and fresh with little oxygen character. Got this one fresh methinks. Keep up the good work Avery!,4.8,Salvation,Belgian Strong Pale Ale
4073,Avagadro,"Another one of my favorites that I have just never gotten around to reviewing. Beer is currently being served at fridge temp (I've had it at all temps by now, and on a hot summer day nothing beats a cold PA). Poured into an American pint glass. A nice fluffy off-white head formed, and slowly receded to a layer of foam floating on top of the beautiful brew. This beer is clear, and straw colored. Aroma is clearly dominated by citrusy American hops. Lots of aroma is being eminated, no need to even swirl to get a full ""wiff"". The aroma told the truth, flavor is dominated by a smooth and mild citrusy hops flavor, with a nice smooth maltiness to bask it up. For a pale ale, this is pretty damn hoppy, but still alittle mild for me. Definitely not your average PA. Founder's seems to like to have a certain degree of thickness in its beers, and that is seen here. Most other pale ales I have are pretty light bodied, but this has alittle more to it, no where near the body of its others though. Drinkability is amazing. I love this beer, but normally go for the more hoppy Centennial IPA, or Red's Rye. If you are liking your PAs and are afraid to move on to IPAs, I'd use this as a stepping stone. I think its one of the better pale ales out there.",4.92,Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA)

Taste is similar, extremely rich and complex, engaging and lively. It has rich spicy-sweet caramelized dark breads, rum-soaked dried cherries and caramelised jam, a hint of plum pudding, strong earthy-toasty finish and earthy-spicy bitterness.

[undersigned] The President of Baltika Brewery[,] T. K. Bolloev"". It poured with a finger's worth of thick, deep-tan head with decent retention. The color was a deep, dark brown with ruby highlights. The nose had a cocoa, chocolate, roasty aspect to it, making my mouth water in anticipation. The mouthfeel was medium with a boatload of chocolate and dried fruit flavors, like raisins and prunes on the palate. The finish was pleasantly sweet, chocolaty, raisiny, and downright delicious.

The first beer I've reviewed. After drinking a number of good IPAs I've found my most recent favorite and first one worth reviewing. I'm a fan of IPAs in general. This is not excessively hoppy, like ""hopslam"" or something of that order. White Hawk is has an incredibly bold front with a citrus hop finish. The hopp blend is without a doubt like orange rind. It poors clear with a solid honey color. The head is frothy and tenacious. The lacing sticks around until you clean the glass. The bold malty front reminds me of ""Amarillo Brilo"" at ""Peace Pizza"" in Chicago. Midrange you get prepared for the perfect balance of citrus hopp. Sometimes IPA's have no front end and give it to you at the finish. Not White Hawk. You are completely covered. Not fizzy or overly carbonated. I can't get enough. This is the only IPA I can drink without a break. I don't need something in between to snap me out of the hopp grip.

The head retention was the biggest drawback of this beer; the head from the pour quickly thinned out to a thin, spotty head that floated on the surface of the beer and did not provide any lacing on the glass. The color of this brew made up for the pour head in the appearance category; this beer has a brilliant copper color and poured very clear and crisp. The smell is that of toasted malts with a subtle alcohol nose. Hops were not detected in the aroma, which is true to style guidelines. The taste was a great combination of noble malts. Hardly any hop bitterness in this brew, just enough to balance the malt bomb character. The mouthfeel was clean with good body.

This robust porter could be the best out there and definitely better then the bottle not that there is anything wrong with the bottle. Recieved from the waitress in a nice goblet and had a rich deeper brown color. A thin small head sat on top which was quite dense and never fading. It had avery light beige color and was striking. Carbonation looked to be very nice. Aroma was rich with roasted malts, chocolate malts and hints of coffee. There is also a underlying sweetness too. Taste is thick and robust on the palette. A rich complex taste of roasted malts sweet milk chocolate and espresso. Underneath is another layer of flavor thats sweet and softer, light oak, molasses, vanilla. It enhances the bold malt flavors and brings them into balance. The beer slides down with no effort and has lingering bitter aftertaste from the abundance of rich malts.

It takes a bit and a little warmth to bring out the full spectrum, and when it comes out it really brings some classy and unusual flavors to the table.

It has this ashy cigarette, tobacco smoke taste to it. Not strong, but just a note that leads up with the cannabis taste and then down into the subtle and dry herbal hops. (BE AWARE!!! I do not smoke, I have smoked cigarettes on occasion and this is why I make such reference, my palate is not tainted!!!) This beer is so even and fine. Sharing this with my brother, he looked over and told me its almost like most green bottle beers, but with ultimate class. Well put, this has unyielding class and quality. Alcohol is utterly vacant. Mouthfeel is creamy but clean, refreshing and dry. For 8%abv, this is super smooth and delicious. I could go on and on. But this is well achieved... it's like drinking a cloud of awesome. Overall, probably one of the finest saisons I have ever had. One of the most intriguing and delicate. A bit more aggressive than some but it doesn't break the gates, if you have a chance to buy this, do it! Should I ever see this saison again, hands down, cost doesn't matter, this is another amazing saison from Fantome.

But the head on this beast is otherworldly! A good 2"" of meringue tops this beer and refuses to dissipate! Right now, there is a big chunk of foam clinging to the glass even after the rest of the head has receded to a very thick ring around the glass. Did I mention that I started this beer 15 minutes ago? S: Huge notes of mandarin orange peel and a whiff of honey from the malt supporting the fruit. Faint pineapple notes lift to the surface as well. Incredible aromas! T: Everything the nose promises and then some. On top of the citrus notes from the hops is a crisp, almost minty note in the aftertaste. And boy, does the flavor stick with you. I'll be having dreams of this beer tonight. M/D: How can I sum this up? In a word: perfection. Enough carbonation to support the head for an amazing length of time, plenty to keep the taste buds hopping, but not so much as to distract from the experience.

7675,blakesell,"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a Belgian chalice. Appearance- Beer pours nearly solid black but when held to the light it has just the hint of reddish hues around the edges. Head is hardly present at all, a fingernail thin, but quickly dissipates to tiny specks of carbonation. Lacing on the sides are suprisingly thick. Smell- Liquid smoke with a malty roast background. Very little outside the smoke but dilligence on the smelling reveals toasted wheat bread and french roast coffee. Hops are also present but hardly noticable. Taste- Wow. This is quite a suprise for a cheapy 12oz bottle I bought in Newport, KY. Thick lingering smoke with a big malty chocolate backbone. Roasty and light in the finish. Hops are a perfect balance of bittering, not too much at all. Wonderfully balanced with the smoke here. Mouthfeel- Medium bodied with suprisingly moderate carbonation. The carbonation is hardly visible, but is present on the palate. Drinkability- Once again, this beer shines overall in it's drinkability. If I find this again, which I may in my travels, I will be sure to pick up a 6pk of this. It has just about everything that you need for a perfect smoked porter.

7728,bluHatter,"I've always been a fan of Hitachino Nest ever since I first tried their Red Rice variety. They are some of the most interesting beers I've had the pleasure of tasting. I had never had their XH ale before, though, so here goes... A: This ale was anxious to get out of the bottle. It foamed over before I was even able to begin pouring, and then formed an enormous head in the glass, even with a gentle pour. The head was foamy (big bubbles) and receded very slowly, leaving just a hint of lacing. The ale itself is thick and cloudy red. This is the most interesting type of appearance for me, as it usually indicates vast complexities in flavor. S: Very similar in smell to Hitachino Nest's Red Rice ale. Pungent sweet malty that quickly mellows into a warm citrus. Not unlike A1 steak sauce... or if anybody has ever smelled a millipede that's been stepped on (don't ask, but it's a smell that sticks with you, and this ale is very similar). T: Wow, very strong and pungent... like a well aged bleu cheese. The smell is definitely present in the taste. Bitter, tangy, strong wood flavor - like the wood had a lot of holes in it that the beer was allowed to mingle in and draw all kinds of interesting body from. Every sip is different as I let it breathe. It gets mellower in the glass. You can tell this has been cooped up for a long time - no wonder it was anxious to get out. M: Loads of carbonation. I can tell I will be burping this flavor for a while after I finish it. You can tell there's alcohol here, as my tongue is tingly and raw after just a few sips O: I feel honored that I was able to taste this beer. Hitachino Nest has never disappointed and this is no exception. I only wish this was easier to come by so I could experience it more often and share it with friends. I never thought I'd try a better beer than Hitachino Nest's Red Rice ale, but I think this may be my personal holy grail.",4.95,Hitachino Nest Extra High (XH),Belgian Strong Dark Ale

7864,woodychandler,"CANQuest (TM) beer/bier/biere/birra/cerveza/cerveja # 400 from CANs/DOSEN/BOITES/LATTINE/LATAS/BLIKKEN and I CANnot be more proud! This started out as a stupid lark in response to people who were traveling hither and yon for the latest sought-out release of an RIS and morphed into a campaign to transition craft beer from bottles into CANs and make them more portable and (perceptually) greener at the same time. What once were habits now are vices in a big way. I rarely drink a beer from anything other than a CAN, a tap, or a cask now and while many pooh-pooh my self-imposed exile from BottleLand, I seldom look back in regret. Instead, I have become the touchstone for CANned beers, along with a loyal group of traders, contributors and like-minded individuals. Tonight's beer comes to me/us from einweizenbitte, a clever traveler who refers to me by Woody Allen's given name, Herr Konigsburg and my uncle, Dr. Kirsch as Uncle Cherry. Here's to you, einweizenbitte, and may yours be a very happy Thanksgiving! From the CAN: ""Ardet nec Consumitur.""; ""'Brule mais ne se consume pas', telle est la devise de l'abbaye de Grimbergen. Fondee en 1128 dans un petit village au nord du Bruxelles elle fut a maintes reprises incendiee mais a chaque fois rebatie, tel un phenix renaissant de ses cendres. Au fil de son histoire, labbaye de Grimbergena su conserver la recette d'une biere authentique et de charactere. Cette biere blonde au gout unique et a la mousse abondante se deguste idealment entre 8 C et 12 C.""/""'Burned but not destroyed,' that is the motto of the Grimberger Abbey. Established in 1128 in a small village north of Brussels, the abbey was built by hand many times and each time it has been rebuilt, it has been like a phoenix rising from its ashes. Throughout its history, Grimberger Abbey has known the recipe for an authentic beer with character. This blonde beer has a unique taste with a plentiful head. The ideal temperature to consume this beer is between 46.4 F and 53.6 F."" The Crack & Glug was nearly religious in terms of its experience, resulting in well over two fingers of thick, foamy, bone-white head with excellent retention. I began to regret not having donned the robes of Bro. Woody of the Order of Disorder as the singing of angels could be heard around me. The head slowly fell like a penitent to its knees, leaving behind a beautiful, sticky lacing that begged to be licked from the sides of the glass (as if I were worthy). The nose had a bready, semi-sweet, musty yeast-driven quality that I had to drag myself away from. After all, beer is meant to be drunk, not inhaled. Mouthfeel was medium with an intense yeast mustiness up front, like putting your tongue on the Guttenberg Bible, followed by a sweet cotton candy-like flavor before giving itself over to a slight grassiness. The finish was semi-dry, not bone-dry, but on its approach with a definite yeast-driven flavor. it was about as good a beer as I have ever had from a CAN. Do they allow coolers in church? Maybe at the Church Brew Works ... I am not taking this to the beach or the mountains, however. This is a beer in a CAN to be savored. Seek it out and remember who turned you onto it.

I haven't had it in a few months, but I pick up a woody bitterness that just adds to the coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malt. Bitter, and loaded with coffee.

8037,Gatch,"2012 ""Vintage"" A: Beautiful copper-golden-orange color with the expected soapy, bubbly, frothy, sticky, bright white head leaving behind amazing lace and good, bubbly retention. Gorgeous brew. Disclaimer: will become hazy due to sediment if you choose to pour the entire contents of the bottle. In my opinion, I think it contributes to this beer, but I don't always pour the yeast into the glass. S: My nose is about six inches away from the pint glass as I write this review and I'm experiencing a sensory overload already. Huge burst of fresh, citrusy (mostly grapefruit), and grassy hops. Sweet, slightly roasted malt and sugary, almost buttery booze complements to truly balance this beer out. BR wasn't kidding when they said this will be balanced. As for the taste... T: Exactly the same as the nose but a bit boozier and maltier which is perfect for the style. Nothing overpowers. Just a wonderful balance of fresh, juicy, fruity, resiny hops, sweet, sugary malt, and incredibly smooth, delicious booze. Top notch stuff. M: The essence of smooth, sweet, and balanced. The flavors are incredible, the feel is as smooth as any beer I've had in recent memory, and the finish is exquisite. Resiny, dry, bitter hop oils cling to the palate to remind you this is a big IPA while deliciously sweet, tasty malt and booze slide down your throat. O: Now this is a Double IPA! Bear Republic absolutely nailed this style on the head. I wish I could drink another bomber, but I'd probably be trashed. Everything I expect from this style. You must drink this! Note: I know all 5's should be rare, but at the moment (this is my first beer of the day), this is absolutely top class. I do not see anything wrong with it in my expectations for the style.

The head was not anything to particularly write home about (I do own a goblet glass for these specialties). However, the caramel-coffee smell was very savory, and hard to put down after a drink.

Mouthfeel - Light to medium bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Drinkability - Very smooth and tasty with great balance making a highly drinkable brew. Great overall beer that is very refreshing. It is perfect for summer but would be great at any time of the year. A very good example of a wit-bier. One of, if not my favorite all time beer!!! Highly recommended!!",4.92,Holy Moses White Ale,Belgian Witbier

Wow, another CAN which was filled almost to the brim and which could hardly contain itself when cracked open and began to foam out briefly! I got two fingers of foamy eggnog-colored head off of my initial pour before I had to back off lest it foam over the lip of the glass. As the head fell, a lot of sticky Belgian lace began to form on the edge of the glass. The nose was redolent with hops and my mouth was watering as I typed. Color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was full, thick and creamy with a riot of hops up front with a sweet malty undertone. Wow! Finish was incredibly dry, very spicy with hops but with just enough sweetness to keep it in balance.

Spicey, like cinnamon. Maltey. And a nice clean dry hop at the end. This doesn't have that overburdoning correander edgey taste, rather it is very smooth instead. Mouthfeel is great. Creamy. Hangs on throughout the drink. Finish starts syrupey, and the hop leaves a nice crips cleanliness in the mouth. This is one wonderful brew. I'm not much of a correander person, and that would be typical of many winter beers. This isn't like that. Instead, Rockie's choice of flavors makes for what I consider the most enjoyable winter brew I have experienced. Kudos!",4.6,Never Summer Ale,Winter Warmer
9630,putnam,"At first glance, it looks and smells like Orval. Pale orange liquid, noisy, explosive foam on top (it depleted very quickly in contrast to marburg's report -- should I be using a better rinse?), aromas of candied sawgrass, apricot pits, lemon oils, cherries, cranberries. I hope its not simply the fact that this roast beef sandwich is making me thirsty, but I can't tear my senses away from this pour. On the palate comes the load of bitterness that the aromas were preparation for. I grasp for comparisons: Popering Hommel, Orval, de Ranke XX... this is thoroughly infused with hops. It's primarily a bitterness, rather than an aromatic. And how perfectly balanced it is. Bold, fleshy stone fruits and basementy earthiness triangulate with floral bitterness to open an outburst of marmelade, quince, sappy budlets, chalk and grass flavors. The fizz is unforgiving too. And where's the alcohol flavor? This beer careens about unleashing flavors hedonistic, then earthy, then spicy, then... it's gone. I feel I haven't begun to understand it. Light, yet powerful. Dry, yet packed with fruit. And of course, the boldly included ""brettanomyces"" on the label is backed up in the glass: its a warm horse blanket of mother-earthly goodness. Wow! inebrius, you may have under rated this one. Thanks for the bottle. Now, to try and obtain it. I'm in for a 7-case layer.",5.0,Reinaert Flemish Wild Ale,Belgian Strong Pale Ale

9845,Sycodrummer,"Pours from the black wax incrusted bomber into a snifter, the beer was a medium ruby-brown color with a half finger of white head. The head quickly faded but left some good lacing throughout the sample. Streams of carbonation bubbles ran up the sides of the glass. Served at cellar temperature. The smell was innitially malty with caramel, molasses, slight nut and chocolate and faint alcohol in the nose. The taste was big and rubust malt up front with hints of chocolate, plum, fig, and grape. The alcohol is present but very well balanced and masked so as to not seem as even half of its 10%. Toffee and a carmel nut after taste deliver a slight tinge of bitterness to each sip, but the finish is a big, sweet, malty flavor. Medium body with very little carbonation. For a 10% barley wine the beer is incredibly drinkable. Very little hint of its strength in the nose or the taste. Well-rounded, smooth, and filling. Slightly warming, and very enjoyable. One of my favorite barley wines to date.",4.97,Killer Penguin Barleywine,American Barleywine

This one stands out in my memory; it was the only one that eschewed the whole ""pumpkin-pie in a glass"" thing that so many pumpkin beers fall prey to. Rather, it harkened back to the days when you would brew with pumpkin because, damnit, it's a thing that was available for cheap in the fall and that would ferment. It is a delicious ale first, and a pumpkin beer second. Not at all sweet, initially hoppy with a pumpkin finish. Exactly what I want in a pumpkin-themed fall seasonal.

12770,MasterfulIdiot,"Poured into a Riedel tulip. The liquid is a cloudy orange with tons of bubbles rising up to form a huge, pillowy four-finger head that rose up instantly upon the gentlest pour I could muster. Leaves a thick sheet of lace down the sides of the glass as you drink it. Aroma is very Belgian - yeast, dried lemons, grapes, banana, cloves, pineapple, apple cider, light coriander, and just a hint of funk. Plus a lot more that I can't really name. There's definitely a vinous quality to it, and the aroma is weirdly thick, especially when you swirl it around. Really nice and complex aroma - exactly what I would hope for. Taste hits your mouth like a soft feathery pillow stuffed with bananas and bread (not banana bread), which then explodes with all the other flavors from the nose, with the addition of a spicy, peppery hop character. Finish is raisins, figs, and grapes, with a perfect little alcohol kick. Aftertaste is dark fruit, and incredibly clean - not too sweet or too bitter. Wow - all of the flavors really work together to be maximally delicious. Really incredible! Mouthfeel is wonderfully pillowy from the generous carbonation, and really silky. Body is moderately thick, but helped along by the carbonation. Works perfectly for the flavors. Overall, really delicious beer that I wasn't all that excited for, since this is what I got when I passed through Santa Rosa but missed out on Pliny. But I just feel totally blown away by it.

Head is thick and a light brown color, not white. Lingers forever. Smell: Smells like hints of coffee and chocolate and wonder. And a moderate alcohol smell. Taste: This is where it really knocks it out of the park. VERY rich flavors. The coffee, coco, and the malt of the beer are perfectly bouqueted but offset enough to not be cloying. Pleasant aftertaste that lingers. Feel: Thick and rich, in a good way. The carbonation is just right to avoid it feeling like oil, but no more. Overall: Try this beer.

Aroma is intensely citrusy, again a combination of the hops (largely centenial I believe) and the ringwood yeast used at this brewery. Gentle round malt sweet in the beginning with an oily finish.

It is super effervescent during the pour, which opens an awesome bouquet of light malt and Belgian yeast. The taste is similar to the nose, but there is a certain peanut butter/nutty flavor that I've always gotten from this beer. It's a flavor I almost always get from the 500 yeast and I absolutely love it! The light body and mouthfeel make this beer unbelievably drinkable! I hate that this beer is no longer in 750's :(.

14366,froggyfrog,"Packaging: 12 oz. brown bottle with a black text dominated white label. Vehicle: My favorite snifter. The View: 5.0! I don't even want to pick up my glass to drink this it's just too damn beautiful. On the pour my bowl filled with a glorious thick orange nectar. Resting on top was a thin fluffy-white pillow of pure white foam. As the soft foam dissipated I became aware of the jet stream of carbonation shooting up in a single column from the from the bottom center of my glass. I've been watching it for like 15 minutes now and it's showing no signs of fatigue. A bubbling fluffy white mound about the diameter of a quarter formed at the top of this volcanic rising of carbon dioxide gas and with a subtle rippling motion reinstated the creamy dream-like coating of head across the entire surface of the liquid. The Scent: American hop essentials greet the nose with an amazing creamy quality. I smell a lot of Cascade but it's not confrontational. This beer doesn't threaten to rip your taste buds to shreds, it instead invites you to come in an experience the beauty and natural simplicity of unchecked wholehearted hops. The Flavor: I hate to disturb the eye candy but I can't wait any longer. Here we go. Guess what? It tastes as good as it looks and smells. There is a deep earthy spiciness expertly balanced by a sticky powdered sweetness. Alcohol is pronounced in the finish. The Feel: Again the word creamy is the first descriptor that comes to mind. Mouthfeel is perfect for this beer. The weighty fullness is an excellent accompaniment to high-alpha bitterness. The Ability to Consume: Let's just say I wish I had a few cases of this and not just this one lonely bottle. Well folks, I'm gonna do it. I'm giving this beer fives across the board.

16146,putnam,"Having consumed a large amount of Hannen and Diebels I was excited to try this artisan Dusseldorfer Alt. Ohmygod. This is great. Bronze and drip coffee-brown there is a silky curve to the line of fine fizz that slowly accretes to the surface. The nose is spectacular - reminiscent of Tadcaster products like Nut Brown Ale and Imperial Stout, there is a subtle trace of vanilla and blue fruits buried beneath the impressive load of roasted, crushed walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts. Also noted are aromas of ethereal Palo Cortado barrels and dates. This is a chiseled dry beer in spite of the evidence of serious malt content. On the palate it stings lightly with Champagne fizz then weighs down the midpalate with velvety textured, earthy tannins before finishing on a hard, clean, peppery note of raw iron. Perfect to drink while listening to Coltrane, John or Alice.",5.0,Uerige Sticke,German Altbier

The middle is some caramel malt and some breadiness, then more hop scent on the finish. Taste & Mouthfeel - Wow! A big mouthful of pine hops. After that passes you get some smooth caramel malt and just a nice smooth bready taste. The end finishes with the piny hop bite. Wow this was not was I was expecting here. The nose had me thinking hop bomb but damn, so much more! Drinkability - So the guys that make Peche Mortel brew this. I'd trade all my Peche Mortel for all of these. I love this beer.

16400,spoonhawk,"The beer is a dark brown with deep mahogany highlights around the edges when held up to the light. The body this on the lighter side of heavy, but the feel is full and slick. The smell is a mix of dark fruit, brown sugar, a hint of yeast, and alcohol. The flavor opens up big with a baseline of dates and figs mixed with caramel. Hints of cocoa come through mid-sip as the alcohol enters the mix, which gives the underlying flavor something of a brandy-like quality. As the alcohol continues to push at the close, the cocoa fades and earthy hops come through. The lasting flavor mixes dark candied fruit balanced by alcohol and light herbal and spicy hops.",5.0,Wee Heavy,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy

I lucked out and got to try their Stille Nacht at Den Stillen Genieter in Mechelen, Belgium (along with all the Westy beers!) and then decided to visit the brewery cafe during out trip. Was a great experience...got to try the Arabier and of course Oerbier...really neat family running the place! Bought a couple six-packs and some posters to take with us and continued to look for their beer wherever we happened to be while in Europe...we were fortunate enought to find a few of their beers in a couple other spots. since we returned to the US, I have still only been able to find Dulle Teve and the Export Stout, but i am jazzed whenever I do...these guys make some seriously excellent beers.

It still maintains the good, opaque mahogany color, along with the great blend of dark candy sugar, dark fruits and caramel malts, as well as the right amount of phynols for a Dubbel. The caramel phynol aroma and subtle carbonation compliments the nicely robust, grainy aftertaste this beer has. There is no annoying bitterness to worry about, which is fantastic for the style. In fact, this beer is so good, Anheiser-Busch discontinued it instead of making more of it!!

18862,DavidS333,"Burton Baton by Dogfish Head Brewery is a Double/Imperial IPA. Its froth is close to medium on the side of light on a scale of light/medium/thick. Its body is about the same on a similar scale. Its smell is refreshing and sort of sweetish. The color is of a slightly darker than usual effervescent amber. The taste of Burton Baton is sort of unique. According to the brewer this is a sort of whiskey-esque Double, in that it is a combination of ""new"" brew and ""old"" brew, with the old brew being aged in barrels. I've got to say that this adds quite a sweet and mellow taste to the beer. It's as though the usual hoppy flavor is sort of veiled by this perhaps semi-smoky or sort of woody sweetness that gives it a really unique sort of scarf-taste over the hoppy taste if you will. The aftertaste still has the sort of characteristic hop taste, but it is somewhat sweetened by that same woodiness. The aftertaste sits nicely on the tongue as a sort of mellow spice. Overall I would say this is a great beer. I really like the way that Dogfish Head tried something different here, and it makes for a great, very savory yet mellow, hoppy beer. Overall a great brew. As a side note, it leads me to wonder perhaps as to the ""original"" flavor of the Double IPA, and if perhaps this sort of creative approach to modern Double IPA's suggests the original Double/Imperial taste per se. I've heard conflicting stories as to the origin of this type of beer. One suggests that this Imperial title relates to the beer having been sent to the far reaches of the British empire, namely India and hence its extra hoppiness was good for preservation's sake per se. Another suggests that this same preservation was needed in the 14-17 hundreds and was requested by the Russian big-wigs per se from English brewers, and that the double hoppiness was both to their liking, and also amiable to the long voyage that such a journey may have been in those days(St. Petersburg on the East Coast of Russia was founded in 1700 or so according to Wiki, hence a beer voyage in those earlier days would have presumably involved both a land and sea voyage to Moscow). Either way, original IPA's were probably in a sense barrel aged aswell. Hence perhaps this beer is a sort of more 'original"" Double/Imperial than it might seem. Either way a great beer, the aged quality just makes it more sweet, tasty and mellow. A great beer with a different dimension than most other Imperials/Doubles. The brewer's advisory to ""hoard"" it seems like a good suggestion.",5.0,Burton Baton,American Imperial IPA
18948,sudz42,"This is a best buy beer at $5.29 from High Falls, essentially a re-marketed Genessee Brewing Company. High Falls kicks it up a notch with a presumably all-malt product, this one having big hops without being overpowering. There are none of the acetolactate dicetyls as mentioned in previous review, so don't be swayed by that. The finish leans to the caramel malt and for my taste could be lighter; but this isn't necessarily a bad thing since it limits to about 2 bottles to feel sated (as opposed to 4 or so for a lighter beer). I was a huge fan of Genny Cream, 12-Horse Ale and Genny Bock, which besides Creamers have disappeared from the shelves. But that's OK so long as Dundee's is coming out with product like this APA.

I thought I knew what I was getting into with this bad boy, but when push came to shove, I was woefully unprepared. I managed to score a 32oz growler of this nectar from a tap house today and was looking forward to settling into a good movie and a couple of imperial pints. It pours a bit like bottled Guinness, and not that fancy schmancy widget ""draft bottle"" stuff, but rather the old school, tan label, ""we scored a crate off a truck in Armagh"" Guinness bottles. Thin, but not watery. Black as coal, with almost zero carbonation. A tiny cocoa brown head forming at the top of the pint. I was instantly intrigued. As for bouquet, it is stouty and complex without being overly so. There are hints of dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, and (unsurprisingly) bourbon. I tipped the pint to my lips and BAM! The taste. Smooth, thick, coffee laced, with a delicious oatmealy richness, but what most surprised me is the dryness. The high ABV is reminiscent of Monster's Barleywine more than any stout I've ever had. At first, it almost put me off. But the more I had, the more I realized how delicious and balanced it is, even with its extraordinarily high alcohol content. The mouth on this beer is slightly syrupy and thick, as it coats the tongue, but it maintains its traditional stout drinkability. It's as if a standard, run of the mill, draft Guinness had a love child with Sam Adams notorious triple bock. Potent, yet incredibly drinkable. This is not a beer for beginners, or for tossing back.

20564,Surefire,"The only thing that I dislike about Sam Adams Porter is that it is only offered once a year, and in a variety pack.

S: Multi layered smells include Mild chocolate, coffee, mocha, regular chocolate, and spices (from the hops). T: Serious flavors, and multi-layered. Chocolates, coffee, cream, mocha, spices, etc. M: Heavy to full body, and layers of cream. D: Best porter I have ever tried. Has the perfect balance of sweet, tart, and bitter.

Raisins and figs combine with ripe cherries upfront. Nutmeg and cinnamon, and banana bread with nuts in it round out the flavors. Soak all of this in dark rum, and you start to get an idea as to what this tastes like. The alcohol is slightly noticeable. The mouthfeel is very thick and bubbly. The drinkability is off the heazy.

T - incredible sweetness and fruity notes up front, followed by a smooth coriander and spice finish as a Belgian should be. Little aftertaste, well balanced. M - Crisp and light, smooth and fresh on the tongue, no heaviness to speak of. Drinks light like a pils with the flavor and alcohol of a strong Belgian. D - Very drinkable, for the alcohol content this beer is suprisingly light. The sweetness/spiciness is not overpowering and the body is still incredibly enjoyable. 2-3 beer session.

22042,rajendra82,"Last year, the Rye² was my favorite Monster beer from Terrapin. That was at the Taco Mac pint glass poured with no head, and served too cold. Now that I can get this in bottles, it was time to give the beer the proper serving treatment of a Tulip glass at cellar temperature. The beer came out cloudy peach in color, with a small head that was beige. The smell was very citric hops, with a tinge of spice. From the first sip, the hops were clearly in command here, just as they are in the little brother Terrapin Rye Pale Ale. There was also a lot of sweet malt that was just short of syrupy. The thick body provided to be a good hop delivery vehicle, although it was not as tongue coating as it could have been. This was certainly more in the mould of a classic DIPA when compared to the Big Hoppy Monster. The sweet, hoppy, and spicy, flavors never quite dominated as they do in some of the big West Coasters. Very easy to drink despite the 8.5% ABV. Purchased on the day of the release 13 April 06.

A beautifully set up, organized and well-run first class operation! Bins full of imported English malts, a huge variety of hops and all the bells and whistles. They have 5 Barrel on tap, in both nitro and carbonated forms - so I had a growler to go! I liked the creaminess of the nitro, but knowing it would go flat, had a mixture poured into my jug. It travelled will, and still has plenty of fizz! It was worth the drive! There are a half-dozen hops that go into the process of making this beer, Willamette being the most prominent. I tasted it green right out of the yeast tank - even then it was delicious! But the nitro version is SO creamy smooth!!

22484,3nlightenedfool,"Let me start this review off on the wrong foot. I drank this straight out of the bomber it came it. Appearance: Who cares. Smell: It smells strongly of piney hops. Taste: Now, to the part worth reviewing...Although it smells predominantly of piney hops, the taste is perfectly balanced with the rich malt flavor. This beer is smooth as silk. It goes down like water. As a lover of IPA's and rich malty ales, this is a grand slam beer. It is intensely hoppy but not really bitter due to the rich malty backbone that is just perfect for the hop flavor present here. Mouthfeel: Rich and smooth. It coats the mouth and doesn't leave an unpleasant taste behind. It is still piney and sweet. Just top notch. Overall: Need I say more. For a beer with 9.9% alcohol, it goes down soooo easy. It's for hop lovers, no doubt, but this one is so well balanced that I think it will make hop lovers out of many people who try it. The hops aren't overly complex and they are not very bitter compared to the explosion of flavor that they provide in this beer. In many IPA's the hops are just a bitter component, but in this beer they are almost purely herbal/earthy in the nose and mouth. The sum it up briefly: This beer is full of flavor, easy to drink, and very strong. Every beer lover should try this beer. It is one of my top 5.

23030,Goblinmunkey7,"Split many a bottle and shared more than a few glasses with angrybabboon. This review is #300 and is of a 2012 vintage. Some additions were made from my notes on previous vintages. Appearance: Pours thick, dark, and completely black. Dark tan head drops to a thin collar in short order. Wispy head on the beer. Almost nothing. Coats the glass. It's not lacing. It must be congealed awesomeness. Very thick with a decent carbonation given the pour. Sits still and heavy. Smell: Oak and booze. Deep dark fruits run the gamut from figs and plums to cherry and raisins. Dense on the dark fruit. Port is prevalent, adding some sweetness and dropping a nice sharp woody aroma. Burnt and roasted almost to the point of absurdity. Char, chocolate (both milk and bitter cocoa), with some minor roasted coffee. Leather and fresh, wet tobacco leaf. Almost fudgey without the sugary sweetness. Taste: Big heat up front. Port and oak make up a big component of the first wave of flavor. Chewy fudge layered with cocoa. Deep red wine, day old coffee. Some dark fruit, with a preference for raisins and plums. Juicy leather. Tobacco leaf, wet and uncut. It's booze soaked dessert. Decadence. Layers of char and burnt and over-roasted malt add a layer of sweetness that helps keep things moving. Massive. Some lingering alcohol. Mouthfeel: Full and thick. Somehow the carbonation is present. Syrupy without crossing in to the realm of actual syrup. Coats the mouth, but the carbonation breaks it up just enough. So very carefully treads the line of too much. With great risk comes great power...or something. Overall: She is that damn good. I've had the privilege to try this beer multiple times starting in '08, only missing '09. It has been and remains the insurmountable representation of the style. The consistent level of complexity gets better with age, but damn if Kate doesn't drink like a beast when fresh. This is a beast and a half. The hype train may have run away with it, bit I have a hard time not accepting the associated accolades.

25144,mempath,"perhaps the best of the dundee 12 pack out now... pours a nice dark 'tawny' with tons of subatomic lacing. nice to see! head remains for awhile without my usual violent, hearty pour. smell is oddly that of a normal pale, a bit malty. suprising but enjoyable nonetheless. a sip and a savor and gulp reveals more hops than malt by far and it's very very well balanced. again, surprised and i like that this is another fairly hopped beer that is perfect for those who want a great session IPA and those afraid of hyperhopbombs. THIS DOESN'T PRETEND TO BE, so a SHAME that some folks are judging this as if it was meant to be an APA or DIPA or something. all in all, great mouthfeel, perfect carbonation, a simply ENJOYABLE ipa.... by the way, if i thought this was mislabeled, i'd at least try another bottle to make sure before i just flat out gave it something potentially undeserving. my bottles had plenty of hop presence. very recommended! edit: came back to this and it's just as exceptional for what it really is...i like the most hopbombed brews out there, but i think alot of folks who are into bitterness and not balance are dogging this brew as they do many others....",4.68,Dundee India Pale Ale,American IPA

Loads of other flavors, something creamy and vanilla, and a little grassy? but in a good subtle way. Very balanced, the hops don't overwhelm like with some other DIPAs. Alcohol very well hidden. As it warmed added a nice caramel undercurrent as well. M: Thick mouthfeel, leaves the pallet very cleanly though. Just the perfect amount of bitterness. Can still feel the carbonation.

25756,pmcadamis,"A - I like the cartoon-y pirate art on Clipper City's Heavy Seas series bottles. This one pours deep garnet hue that looks russet when not in direct light. The head holds at about one finger, and leaves TONS of really sticky fine lace on the glass. S - Gooey toffee, caramelized sugar, banana flavored Laffy Taffy, dates, honeycomb, almonds, Worther's Original candies, molasses, and raisins. Holy shit. This is outstanding! T - Much more hoppy in the mouth than in the nose, this is caramely, toffee laden, honey-sweet, but never cloying. Big time pine hops combine with a nice ethanol burn to make a pleasant flavor, but it's much milder than most Barley Wines that I've had. Maybe that's why this one is listed as an English version...I think all of the others that I've tried have been American, West Coast versions (ie Bigfoot). M - Thick, rich, sweet, and round. The carbonation is luscious to the point of absurdity. This is beyond full bodied...I'd call it fat bodied or maybe buxom. Anyhow, the finish is dry and hoppy with a nice boozy burn in the back of the throat and a long lasting hop flavor that sticks to your teeth. D - Outstanding beer. Not the best I've had, but damn close. This is definitely hanging close to that highest echelon of good beer. This is however, more drinkable than some more aggressive barleywines, and I could probably drink two or three, though I'd be a little bit tipsy after more than one.",4.72,Heavy Seas - Below Decks (Barley Wine Style Ale),British Barleywine

26159,kencarman,"I never have had any beer that I have rated this well. To me, and to my wife Millie, if you were to imagine an excellent Golden Ale from Belgium merged with the perfect amount of hops to balance it out, this would be it. I was amazed at the brewer's ability to prove his talents when it comes to his craft. The color, the somewhat hazy, deeper than straw that one would expect. Mouthfeel... not overly carbonated, but well carbonated as per style. Aroma? Hops and expected banana-clove... slight. I would be so damn proud of this one, if I brewed it, I'd piss off my relatives by bragging too bloody much, so I'm glad they brewed it instead. I did not have any of the gusher, carbonation problems that other reviewers did, but of course this was just one bottle bought in Concord, Mass at Colonial... a very well stocked outlet that competes quite well with Yankee Spirits, especially considering their superior knowledge and care they seem to take with product.

It is as if this beer climbed a mountain and screamed citrusy hops. Absolutely breathtaking. This just might be the best smelling beer I have drank to date. The taste is all that a pale ale should be and more (but not so much more that it infringes on IPA territory). Citrusy hops dominate the flavor but there are also nots of pine. The mouthfeel is perfect; medium-thick bodied, with nice carbonation, and oh so smooth and creamy. Overall, this is by far the best pale ale I have ever had.

Jack's was more balanced and more like beer and it was just right with the spice. I hope they have it next year!,4.51,Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale,Pumpkin Beer
26277,assurbanipaul,"Pours a dark amber brown with a mountainous head, more than 2/3rd of the glass. Nose is spicy, malty, elements of cinnamon and coriander with a slightly sweet fruity character. To call it a ""nose"" is disparaging -- this beer has a bouquet. Initial taste has a bit of a tang to it, not quite sour but soon yielding to a soft malty sweetness. Flavors of candy sugar, some mild spices, some yeasty tangy elements again covered with caramel and tea flavors. Very, very light cinnamon and lemon rind, very light buttered toast. A symphony of flavors with a lingering spicy-sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is soft and fluffy, carbonation keeps a bite to it. Smooth and dangerously easy to drink, no hint of a suggestion of a trace of alcohol, regardless of its ABV. Outstanding, a beer without a flaw. There simply is no way I can score it any less.

The flavor is a rich hop fueled mix of pine and citrus first, followed by some very unusual herbal tones, that mostly serve to remind me of earl grey tea. The mouthfeel perfectly catches a balance between light and redolent with rich oils. Overall this an amazing beer - best fresh hop beer of the season so far.

This is an EXTREMELY well balanced beer, with the perfect amount of bitterness to complement the strong malt content. The taste is truly unique and refreshing, but not overly bitter like most American winter brews (otherwise known as IPAs).

Wisping cappucino cream showing thinly. Pumpkin pie greets the nose first, then chicory blend coffee, and a little sticky bun scent hit the nose, and tastebuds follow suit by watering. Delicious. For the most part the flavor follows the same lines as what you read straight above when I was talking about the smell of this creation. Added to it, though, is a certain electric flash that occurs as the moderate carbonation and thick body coincide with one another, and a hop/coffee bitterness develops henceforth, giving total closure to the whole experience. This beer gives true closure to fall and welcomes winter. Wide breadth of flavor and nuance and just the way that it drinks, it is spot on for a seasonal at this exact time and place.

The head last as a thin film with nice lacing for most of the beer. S- This beer has a soft yeasty note of faint bananas and circus peanuts which are subtle and balanced soon give way to a bolder toasted note and a robust caramel sweetness at the finish. T- The rich caramel malt flavor has some darker roasted notes to it with a soft alcohol heat and white raisin quality. There is a soft cola note that gives way to an apple butter note to the malt and a soft toasted malt flavor to boot. The finish is a soft herbal bitterness that wraps up the malt flavors quite nicely without big hop flavors. M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with a soft alcohol heat and a tight little fizz in the finish that enhances the herbal bitterness. D- This beer has a great depth of flavor and a perfect support of the wonderful caramel malt. This grand cru is like a great loaf of fresh bread.

Look: Typical dark black stout - not a great amount of head, but what was there stuck around the whole time and left a great looking lace on the glass. Smell: Lots of dark chocolates, coffees, roasted grains. Very deep aromas - you could leave your nose in the glass for a long time and really enjoy it. Taste: early dark fruit flavors, followed by some chocolates/coffees, and then finishes with a real nice toffee/caramel/dark maple syrup sweetness. Like most other RIS, let this one warm up to the recommended temperature because it tastes so much better than when it is refrigerator cold.

A: Opaque, nearly black, arrived with no head at all, and a small rim of bubbles that left a little bit of lace. Excellent sign of what's to come. S: Rather subtle for the style. A bit of the fruity esters, and the only thing that stood out as different was a hint of soy sauce smell. T: Excellent. Quite smooth, and solid but not overbearing. Malty, sweet, and with only a little bit of roasted flavor - just right, I thought. Definitely chocolate, but not your standard bitter dark chocolate flavor - almost a chocolate Twizzler. If that sounds weird, don't worry, it's good. A very nice balance with the fruit, which was there when you wanted to pay attention to it, but not in the way. M: Slightly thin by comparison to others, but little to complain about. Works just fine. D: Would be dangerous if I didn't like taking my time with a beer like this. Goes down easy.

Rich, lush pine- pine from the deep, untouched Canada- if there is such a pine. That's what I think of anyway, dammit. Rich, untouched Canadian pines blowing in the crisp, cold wind, with trout hopping in the river and Grizzlies frolicking about on the grassy knoll above. Hints of citrus as well. Taste: Wow, what can I say. This beer is absolutely delicious, in my opinion. The pine taste matches the smell, and the bitterness is exquisitely balanced.

Its Simcoe hop flavoring gives it a very good welcome to the Double/Imperial genre if one is new to it, and it definitely leaves one wondering more about this genre of beer. That this beer is sometimes available in semi-keg form, makes it one of the best gifts to a beer aficionado that one can give(beer-gift wise), and I think overall that this is a really satisfying American Double/Imperial.",5.0,Double Simcoe IPA,American Imperial IPA

30423,OStrungT,"This beer pours a slightly cloudy dark golden color, with a thick fluffy off white head. The head fades slowly, leaving thick laces. This beer has a strongly spicy aroma. Pepper and coriander. I also detect a nice citrus hop aroma. Lemon and orange are present. It has a very subtle earthy yeast aroma. This beer tastes like it smells. All the flavors are mild. A spict flavor is present. Some citrus hops are apparent also. It is very well balanced. This beer is very crisp and refreshing. It is highly carbonated. It goes down very smooth, leaving a slight spicy aftertaste. This beer would make a great session beer. It tastes good, so having many would ot be bad at all. The only thing to be careful for is the 7% ABV. Too many might lead to the need for a DD. Overall: This beer is great.

30970,DavidS333,"This beer is taste filled American Double/Imperial ale. It has the sort of lack of froth or carbonation which one sometimes sees in beers of this variety. I'm not sure if its coincidence or an omen if one will, but every time I've had a beer with little froth, and a medium+ body it has always been very full of flavor, and surely this ale/beer is no different. The beer's color is a quite dark sort of a light caramel, and is not very transparent. The flavor of this beer is very rich, and one might argue, changes depending on how one drinks it. If one take it into one's mouth as usual and swallows it, one gets a quick splash of the rich flavor of this beer, like someone quickly opening and closing a decorative fan. However, one gets a much different and more varied, and still rich perspective on this beer, by taking it into one's mouth and holding it in the front of one's mouth for a moment, whereby its rich hoppy-rye combo really comes out. The rye emphasis gives this beer a very fresh taste at the beginning, and perhaps serves as a sort of shell for the hoppiness that this beer possesses. Once one swallows said gulp/sip one is treated more to the hoppy aftertaste that has a real tendency to linger, giving one that unique and tell tale good and hoppy aftertaste. If I had to compare this beer to other hop-heavy brews per se, I would say that the top notes per se, of the flavor have a really distinctive what I presume is ""rye-ness"" about them, with the hops forming a solid body of taste, and aftertaste underneath said ryeness per se. This makes for a really rich and unique ""art-beer"" if one will, that really showcases a brewers ability to mix fore-tastes and after-tastes in a unique way, which I presume Mr. Bruce/Schneider would be happy to have named in his honor. For, this is really a great and tasty beer.",5.0,He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.,American Imperial IPA

31763,monkist,"To my deepest regret I wasted 50 ml of this liquid gold when opening the cap and letting the head overflow... as excellent as a beer this is, it is such a pity. But looking at the bright side of things: the bottle is filled 355 ml so I am just where I should be with a standard bottle of craft IPA! Chinook and Centennial perhaps (and checking the bottle, yes indeed) that are heavy in the nose, seriously and freshly dry hopped, perhaps a new batch. Excellent, refreshing, lively. Drinks very easily, feels like I could back it down like water but with the full pleasure of an amazing craft IPA. Wow. Not quite sure where Coronado is located in California but somehow reminds me of Anderson Valley, being somewhere deep in the woods, surrounded by vast areas of nature - interesting enough, this is what comes through the beer. The feeling of freshness lasts throughout, perhaps that's why you feel like drinking and drinking it, simply because it's so uplifting. As it thaws out more and more, the hops give it a deeper taste, something more complex than citrusy freshness. The hops are combined in a way that it smells and tastes somehow caramelly hoppy, earthy and piney. Not sure if there is a reason to discuss it any longer - not sure if this playful taste could be described in any more detail. Simply pop one open - and don't let it overflow!

Strong, satisfying flavor lives up to the promise of the aroma and appearance, being strongly smoky with tones of rich roasted coffee, unsweetened chocolate, and burnt caramel, with nutty and butterscotch hints. Texture is satisfyingly smooth and thick, leaving a smoky aftertaste that has touches of both hoppy bitterness and honey sweetness.

(T) The taste delights me to no freaking end! It is like a sour beer with powerful notes of strawberry chocolate frappuccino LOL! Freaking incredible and so different! There is also that classic porter taste in the background that chills in your mouth and lets you know your drinking a dark beer. A flavor for the gods I assure you. Dont worry about the higher alcohol level in this beer. It is masked like a jello shot that only warms you once it is in the stomach.

32360,sublimesipping,"So, after an extended absence, this reviewer is back with another sublime beer to report on. Much anticipated release from the folks in San diego does not fail to dissappoint. An amazing beer with much to write home about. Poured from the bottle into an oversized wine glass; the color of the beer is one of the more beautiful that I have seen in a long time, deep royal ruby red amber, nice silky glass lacing and head retention indicates freshness. Smells of herbs and hops a sophisitcated sweet smell that promises much and delivers. I would say that this is a like a beautiful belgian with a distinct character and bitterness of an IPA. The 10% alchohol makes its presence felt but it is not overpowering. the beer is super silky smooth and was a joy to drink on the back deck with an old friend(who drank Rolling rock- one of the last latrobe brewed bottles), OK. I love tis beer! It is SOPHISTICATED! with a capitol ""S""! The profile of the beer changed as the bomber was killed over the afternoon, but unlike other reviewers the alcholol did not become edgey in my palate's estimation. Drinkability is slow relfective as it should for this sublime experience. A special occassion beer- say for an anniversary? I can't wait to age some of the case that I've luckily been able to get my hands on. Look for updates to this review in 2011 and 2016. Happy 10th Stone for a job continuously and righteously, need I say outrageously welldone! cheers! Thanks for the beer memories... 3 bottles into the case and my review hits 5s across the board.

32423,benito,"Wow. This is a really remarkable beer. Huge, soapy/bubbly head atop a peach colored brew. Aromas of orange peel, grains of paradise, and unidentifiable bittering hops. There's a slight, sour-yeast scent as well. Each sip reveals an amazing variety of flavors: ginger, orange, paradise seeds, lemon, honey, and green tea, amongst others. The spice-driven flavors are backed with a smooth, long-and-dry finish and a just-so hint of bitterness that adds a tremendous level of refreshment to the beer. Medium in body with ever-evolving flavors. At times, the ginger stands out; with the next sip, it's the earthy hops. I don't know that I've ever had another beer that shows such a wide range of flavors with such consistency. It's a true surprise every time.

32435,thebrood1987,You definitely get that strong scent that you get in a quality witbier the orange and corriander scent with an oats smell. I also get some grapes in the smell as well. The taste really has a nice bite from the carbonation reminding you that yes this is still a beer and an herbal hop bite comes into play on the initial sip and aftertaste. I get the orange and corriander with a sherbert taste and creaminess. I also get the grape must taste mixing in with the orange flavors. The taste is sweet and definitely knocks you back on your first sip. It definitely tastes like an Imperial witbier but with an extra juicyness not found in any witbier I've had. I also get a faint woody oak flavor in there as well. This is a unique beer that really took me for surprise with how much flavor can be packed into one beer.

Surly Fest is made with the same gusto as Abrasive, Furious, Darkness, and pretty much every other brew they make. Fest tastes like no other Octoberfest out there. It is unmistakeably hoppy, yet not too much so it takes away from what it is. I'd hate to call it an IPA-esque Octoberfest, but that's a fairly accurate description. Very attractive red-bronze color and a fairly thick head, agreeable aroma, and a smooth mouthfeel with a pleasant hint of carbonation.

32941,Faro,"A heartfelt thanks to hoppymeal for sending me a growler in a trade. This is a wonderful beer. It comes in a typical half-gallon jug type growler with a big circular label with the brewerys information. The specific beer is written on the cap. Appearance: Pours with a thick, dark, frothy head into my Stone 10th Anniversary pint glass. The thick head sticks around the edge as I drink the entire glass. There is a slight lacing present. The beer itself is a very dark, opaque brown. Smell: Wonderful! Roasted chocolate and roasted coffee fills my nose. The coffee is somewhere between a dark and medium roast. Taste: Roasted, toasted chocolate and coffee dominate with a fair dose of welcomed sweetness. The coffee and chocolate blend nicely. Very mild hops are barely detectable. They provide a bit more complexity of flavor and they dissipate quickly. Mouthfeel: A wonderful silky, creamy mouthfeel, almost chewy. Reminiscent of a glass of Silk soymilk. The carbonation is a bit higher than most double stouts but perfect here. The finish is crisp and clean. Smoother than I expect for this style probably due to the carbonation level. It works quite well. Drinkability: I could drink a growler of this beer each week. Though it is very rich, like a dense chocolate cake that you want to keep eating. Breakfast stouts are a new style for me and I love them. This beer is up there with my favorites: Founders Breakfast, Kentucky Breakfast and Terrapin Wake-N-Bake.

33205,mfunk9786,"Looks can be deceiving. A: This beer pours a very average watery black that one has become accustomed to with a low-ish ABV stout. Nothing special. An off-white head that laces well, but doesn't get as sticky as some beers do. You wouldn't think this would be one of the best pumpkin beers ever conceived by looking at it. S: A lovely combination of pumpkin, cinnamon, and allspice. Some roasty chocolate and brown sugar on the finish. What an aroma! T: This beer tastes absolutely amazing. Some might be a little puzzled by the idea of a pumpkin stout, but it's such a great execution of this Frankenstein-ed style that you'll never question anything again. In your life. The best thing about the flavor is that it's not overspiced like a lot of pumpkin beers, there's a great balance of flavor between dark chocolate, pumpkin meat, and light pumpkin spices. There's a definite hint of whipped cream sweetness on the finish, like a liquid version of the best dessert you've never had. Gives Pumking a definite run for its money as the best pumpkin beer ever. M: Smooth. The restrained spicing leaves this feeling very cool and pleasant on the tongue. Perfect for what it is. D: Couldn't be more drinkable. I could drink a six-pack of this beer in about 20 minutes. It's just so cool and smooth and lovely - it's dangerously drinkable. No alcohol presence whatsoever.

34069,160Shillings,"Aroma: The aroma is full of strong malt; caramel, roasted and rich floor malt, also includes faint esters and surprisingly very faint alcohol as well. Appearance: Pours with a tan head that collapses into a fine bubbled ring. The color is very dark copper. Flavor: The flavor begins with sweet malt, caramel and roasted notes. The body is surprisingly full for a beer that the label says has only 6.1% abv, it almost seems sticky sweet. However that is a deception since the palate soon becomes dry and shows full attenuation. The bitterness is appropriated, but does not linger. The finish is unexpectedly dry, short and abrupt. It’s not the finish one would expect from an ale that begins so very rich and sweet. It leaves you easily ready for the next swallow and even the next beer. The esters suggest dark fruits, for those that think they are wine connoisseurs, for beer zealots it tastes like a great Scottish ale. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-low carbonation, without lingering. Overall Impression: This Scottish ale is everything it should be and nothing it shouldn’t be, a true benchmark for Scottish ale. Comments: Thank you Garrett Oliver! Brooklyn’s Winter Ale is a wonderful example of Scottish ale. The web says this beer is 6.0% abv, however my bottle says 6.1% abv. The nominal strength is half a percent lower than guidelines for a Wee Heavy, but 1% abv more than an 80/- Scottish Export. All things said, Winter Ale taste like a Wee Heavy. Most importantly it avoids the two most common failings of American craft-brewed beer. First, it’s not too hoppy. Most American craft-brewers, especially those on the west coast, use far too many hops, even in beer styles in which it would be inappropriate. Second, Oliver doesn’t use whisky malt in this beer.

Smell is of intense chocolate, vanilla, and oak. Not as prevalent bourbon and sweetness intermingle throughout the aroma. Taste reflects the smell. Initial vanilla and roast flavors lead into oak and bourbon characteristics that lead into a pleasant dark chocolate and roast the lingers for a while. Superb. The feel is thick and viscous (lives up to the Viscosity in the name). Some lively carbonation is present to not make this beer flat.

34484,Sak3,"Here is the review of a 2012 one pint Imperial Stout Trooper, thanks to My Beer Cellar. Look: Upon first pouring it, the beer gives a hint of brown and after it filling the glass the drink gives a deep hue of black. Smell: As soon as I opened the glass I got a huge kick of chocolate. After the first whiff the remaining smell was some chocolate and mainly a lot of roasted coffee. Taste: The first taste gives more coffee and less chocolate detected opposed to the smell. As the drink has warmed up to a point nearer room's temperature I have been tasting more chocolate, but still mostly coffee. Feeling: A smooth drink that goes down the hatch without a kick to it regarding the alcohol content. The drink remains a thicker stout that is best after a moment in your mouth to fully enjoy the flavor. Overall: Nothing needed to say other then I am so happy that I was able to find a seller of this 2012 vintage drink in late 2016! Over the course of your beer drinking career I would strongly recommend that you should purchase one of these at some point.",5.0,Imperial Stout Trooper,Russian Imperial Stout
34688,highwa51,"I was very surprised to log onto beeradvocate.com and find that this beer only earned a C+ overall and a C- from the bros. I found that this beer was exquisitely drinkable and delicious. I was in the mood for a spring beer. I usually drink dark malty beers, but i felt a craving for a very hoppy beer, maybe due to the approaching summer and higher temps. I saw this IPA in the air force base shoppette and opted for the RedHook ESB instead (very good ale). After a few stops I finally picked up the longhammer. This IPA hits the spot... perfectly! Appearance - I drink this brew straight from the bottle. I would have poured it into a goblet of some sort, but I just got off work and I need a beer. Smell - this beer smells very much like an IPA, but with overtones not unlike freshcut grass, and an obvious alcohol possession. Taste - after smelling the longhammer I took a very apprehensive swig. First off I was blown away by the balance. The taste was very hoppy and bitter, but finished with an exceptional sweet smoothness. Mouthfeel - very crisp, and refreshing. Drinkability - I believe this is one of the most drinkable beers i have tasted. Some people might be taken back by the absence of the bitterness in this IPA. It is too strong and bitter to be a pale ale. But, if you are looking for balance... look no further.",5.0,Redhook Long Hammer IPA,American IPA

36333,Jtee,"From a 750ml bottle served straight from the fridge at 10 degrees Celsius into an oversized wine glass. Best by date: 16.01.2019 Look: Absolutely gorgeous. The beer pours a brilliant amber-gold with 8cm of dense, rocky, ivory head that settles into a thick cap within 6-ish minutes. Great lacing and overall persistent head. The level of clarity is mind-boggling considering the beer has been dry-hopped. Effervescent. Smell: Strong and well-balanced. Beautiful and delicate nose with a complex yeast profile. Citrusy esters, floral, fruity, and earthy hops, with additional notes of peppery spice, musty cellar, and faint barnyard. Low intensity grainy malts. Taste: Strong and balancing towards bitter following the aroma seamlessly. Complex, quite tart, and highly attenuated. Citrus fruit, peppery spice, earthy & spicy hops, and a layered yeast character. The finish is moderate in length, medium intensity, and leaning towards bitter. Damn delicious! Feel: Medium body with high carbonation. Drying, prickly, and crisp with a restricted, smooth alcohol warming. Strong presence while occupying the palate, but once it's gone it leaves the mouth feeling refreshed and ready for another sip. Overall: Mind-blowing. I feel stupid posting straight fives, but I don't know how a beer could get any better than this. It looks stunning, smells enticing as well as intriguing, tastes delicious with perfect mouthfeel, and it nails the style yet takes it to another level.

36539,mikesgroove,"750ml bottle served at 45 degrees and poured into a Flute Glass A  Poured a very nice and very bright yellow tinted amber. Lots of cloudiness and haze were apparent throughout the glass and only proceeded to thicken up as the bottle got closer to the bottom, really bringing some of the yeast forward on this one. A rather large and intense three inch high head of white frothy and foamy lace then formed on the top and decided that it was going to hang around for a while, and really just did not ever fade. Even once it started too settled, it still reaches a height of almost an inch even toward the end of the session. Needless to say copious amounts of side glass lace were present and coated the entire inside of the glass throughout the entire time. S  Wow, now I knew here I was in for a treat right away. This was such a rich, vibrant, light and fruity smell that I could not nearly contain the joy after the first whiff hit my nose. I am a big fan of Belgian Pales, and especially the ones that have he hop notes to them, and I knew right away I was going to be into something great here. Huge bouquet of light fruity yeast with hints of apples and pears, peaches all coming together and being surrounded by light grains and fresh grass. The topped was a very nice hop profile, bright floral citrus hops, not too pungent, but rather just accenting enough to really bring out everything and meld it together in an aromatic representation of rolling around in a fresh meadow. Just absolutely wonderful. T  As if it could get any better I was then able to finally take a sip. Wow is the only word that would come to mind. This is exactly what I had been looking for. A perfect example of this style and just a testament to what Lost Abbey can really do. The flavor started out as bright as I could have imagined wit ha big wave of fruit flavors just rolling over you bringing mostly hints of apples, pineapple and pear. This evolved and started to incorporate some almost lemon like flavors with hints of grass and grain, but still staying very light and bright in the profile. As it finished up it rolled off with a very long lasting finish. Very nice and dry and bitter you could really taste the hops coming through here about five seconds after your last sip, just dragging you back, making you take another. Just great here, one of the best tastes I have had in a while. M  Very very smooth this light bodied ale was really quite deceptive. The flavors were so big, but the body was so light that you really struggled to figure out how that packed so much into it. Very smooth and creamy, the carbonation here was excellent, never at all getting flat, even the last few sips which I let sit around for about 15 minutes were as fresh as the first. Very nice indeed. D  Now cmon this was just great. A light bodied well carbonated ale with a huge bright flavor profile and low abv too? How could it not be sessionable? Well its almost too good to be sessionable, as it is not like this is easy to get, but if I could have it on tap at my house I would in a second. I dont really think that you could get bored of this one, even after time it just kept getting better. Overall this was a fantastic beer from Lost Abbey. I have been slowly working my way through their lineup and to be honest this is my favorite so far. It was so right up my alley that its not even funny. Such a great light profile and rich flavors, I am not sure how I could have not found this one earlier.

A: This hold a beautiful black color virtually identical to the standard smoked porter. Light brown head left a nice lacing. S: Very smokey, very peppery. Little roasted malt in there, but the smell gets its power from the peppers. T: I like the smoked porter a lot, but the after taste never really did it for me. The peppers in this are the perfect remedy. Up front, you get an amazing smokey flavor, easily paired with any style of BBQ. The spice in the aftertaste warms your throat very comfortably. There are some spicy beers that are killed by the heat (Cave Creek Chill for one). This is the best balance of flavor and heat I've ever seen in a beer. I was genuinely astonished by this beer's quality. D: I can drink this nonstop. The heat isn't enough to make it unenjoyable.

36727,DavidS333,"Le Freak is a sort of hybrid Belgian/Imperial IPA from Green Flash Brewing Co. The smell is fresh and sort of has a sort of vibrant/lightly rich refreshing aroma. The color is a sort of darkened harvest gold. The froth is a little more bubbly and light than one might be used to with just Imperial IPAs. The body is medium on the side of lightish on a scale of light/medium/thick. The flavor of the beer is sort of rich and dynamic. In keeping with the two-beers-combined theme of the beer, hence making it a ""freak"" of a beer. The flavor changes from the front of the mouth as the beer transitions to the back of the mouth. The beer has a sort of rich sort of Imperial style fore taste, that is sort of like a rounded hop-dome if you will, not as steep as Green Flash's ""Imperial"" beer/ale. Once one gets over the sort of rounded hop-hill of taste, the beer sort of mixes into a nice medley of sort of Belgian lightness/gaiety that leaves one with a very satisfying aferaste that is semi hoppy around the edges of the taste per se, with a sort of semi-present hoppiness on the toungue-tip of the taste, leaving a sort of light Belgian-style(perhaps) refreshing taste on the mid portion of the tongue/taste. Overall I think this is a tasty/pleasantly understated-rich beer. It has the initial hop taste that is satisfying if one is a fan of the Imperial/Double genre per se, and it has the nice sort of rich Belgian flavor wave per se, that gives the beer a very sweet/smooth/refreshing mid/aftertaste, and ultimately makes it a beer that is both a pleasure to sip, as well as a pleasure to sort of ""drink"" normally if one will.

That said this is a beer for the working class, and after a hard days labor in the field of carpet covered squares, I needed some potable refreshment, for re-hydrating my mind, and body. The Bistro in Hayward CA. is the place, the atmosphere to accomplish such tasks. I dig saisons and this beer from North Coast was an awesome interpretation. The bouquet was of flowers and fruits, the taste had a bit of spice, but it had a pleasing evervesance that I really dug. It at almost 8% did not have an alchool prescence that lesser beers at such percentage may have. Overall, I dig this beer. Drinking a 750ml bottle on my own, gave me time to appreciate it, as it warmed it got better, more drinkable. It reminded me of Pure Mead, at the first taste, and later as my palate dried. This is excellent with strong cheese and fruit. A white wine alternative...",5.0,Le Merle,Belgian Saison

37157,IronGiant,"My local beer bar recently started carrying Fort Collins - the first time I've seen these beers in New Jersey. Let me get straight to the point: Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA is hands down the best IPA I've ever had. Put this in a blind taste test with a better known, great IPA like Bear Republic Racer 5 and the better known is going down in smoke. Rocky Mountain is the perfect balance of hops and sweetness, carbonation, aroma and aftertaste. It simply is the perfect IPA - or as close to it as I've ever had. Okay, I know I should do the appearance, aroma, taste thing everyone else does. But I don't have time. I'm off to have another Rocky Mountain IPA.",4.97,Rocky Mountain IPA,American IPA

Dark belgian fruits, metallic belgian yeast, BRETT in all its glory. T: OUTSTANDING! More of a brett flavor than I anticipated. Band aids, musty horse blanket, lemons, oranges, belgian fruits, medicinal flavors, faint hops. M: Crisp and delicious. D: Extremely drinkable. Its a crime I can't get more.

37216,cdizinno,"Poured into a tulip glass from a 12oz bottle, bottled on FEB 25 2010, with a papered logo different than pictured. A: Cloudy, pale straw with light white head and decent lacing. S: Very faint, maybe due to alergies, but mild floral hops and very yeasty. T&M: Tastes much better than the faint smell. Nice balance of spices, quality yeast, and mild floral hops. Light to medium bodied. This is close to La Fin du Monde and Duvel in quality. Probably even more drinkable and I recieved it in a local 'beer of the month,' so I'm not sure of the price, but it is probably a great buy for the style!!! The only thing Duvel has on this stuff is a slight edge on the clarity and smell. Excellent! D: Highly recommended. Try with good artisanal cheeses, or an omelet.

37265,Spipenger,"This beer is shear heaven...though damn hard to get and extremely expensive. I typically find this for $15 per bottle in my local bar (Bronx Ale House), and even about $12 per bottle in any supermarket. The pour is a deep, dark black, almost black licorice dark. It has a deep brown head with black highlights. It has a deep, roasted nutty aroma with highlights of very dark chocolate and a hint of black licorice. The texture is very smooth with a touch of a bourbon-barrel to it. Its smooth and slinks down your throat with a bit of a burn as it descends your throat. It is a sipping beer both because of the high alcohol content and because of its taste and texture. You have to savor this beer. I cannot say enough good about this. It's first class. It's high class. It's second to none.

First couple of sips, and I relaized this was an exceptional beer, that had a lot of thought put in it. The wheat just softens all the flavors, and mixes them really well, from the hop biterness, caramel/vanilla flavors, to the nice fruity yeast flavors. can't stop thinking about this beer, as it just lingered on my tongue for seemingly ever.

37966,timtwoface,"Of course, my current favourite beer of all time - a double IPA - is only sold in select places 50km from my house, so I can't enjoy it as much as I'd like. Sigh. Tricerahops is truly a wonder to behold. A glorious ornage/golden cloudy colour, enough hops to make your head spin, but with subtle fruity undertones (but not too fruity) makes this an exception hop-bomb you can enjoy. I first tried this beer on tap at the Great Canadian Beer Festival in Victoria, BC - and ever since, I've loved this beer and nearly anything I've tried from Ninkasi Brewing. I simply must find a way to get more of this one. At 8.8% ABV and a ridiculous amount of IBUs, you may initially pay a premium for the beer's deliciosity but it's a slow drinker so it will last a while - but it's really easy to down as well, despite its alcohol content, so be forwarned. I have one sitting in my fridge waiting for a special occasion (Christmas or New Years, at this point) but I am desperately looking for more of this one.

Pours an inch of light frothy tiny champagne like bubbles. When swirled, the bubbles create small walls with fading patterns as they slide down the fine crystal. The beer is slightly hazy with a touch of unsettled sediment. It is close to opaque, very difficult to see through the beverage. Smell: Dark blackberry, medium malty nose, Black cherry, Cognac and Vanilla. Taste: The same flavors follow through on the pallette. There is a medium minus hop bitterness. Dark berry fruit with subtle power starts and is joined by subtle piny hops flavor with a touch of chocolate malty flavors. Creamy cocoa with edges of Dark cassis and Fig finish wiht a lingering quality of vanilla and dark berries. Baking spices dance in the background of all of these other flavors. Mouthfeel: Medium weight moves into refreshing acidity and edgy bubbles. Bubbles party in your mouth at this point cleansing all the surfaces touched by the beverage. This is so refreshing but still has a light richness and finishes clean with subtle dark berry flavors lingering. Drinkability: This beer is incredibly well balanced and refreshing. It has dark flavors and has the most impressive acidity with well integrated hop profiles. The levels of malt are subtle and the beer finishes dry.

A great pour into a 10 oz. glass produced 1 1/2 fingers of rich, dark mocha head atop a nearly black body, just gorgeous. The nose is excellent--plenty of coffee and chocolate, and a hint of caramel. That and plenty of malt coat the tongue, with a different flavor coming to the fore on each taste. There is also a hint of berry that was most welcome. The carbonation was just right, offsetting a slightly syrupy taste. This is very drinkable, and the moderate ABV make this an ideal Imperial Stout for sampling a few. A delight, and a great find.

38700,RicoBrew,"I was a volunteer beer-pourer at the 2008 GABF and I was helping serve this bad boy next to Garrett Oliver himself. This was my favorite of the cadre of beers Brooklyn Brewery brought with them to the beer fest. A- Straw gold, mildly hazy. S- Nice noble hop aroma, citrusy and floral. They did a great job with the dry hop. The hop nose is powerful, but it gives way to a myriad of other notes rather than just an overpowering hop smell. An underlying bready yeast character comes through on the back of the nose. Extremely pleasant. T- This is beautiful. The hop flavor sits on your tongue for a little bit, but then it gives way to a wonderful light wheat flavor with enough bitterness to prevent it from being overly sweet. Upon swallowing, the hop flavor is resurgent along the back of the tongue giving it a great dry finish. M- A great dynamic occurs between the carbonation and the heavier weissbock aspect of this beer. It sits just long enough on the tongue to impart it's flavor and then fades. No cloying sweetness, not effervescent. D- I definitely could drink a whole bottle of this at one sitting and not realize it.

39639,DavidS333,"Double Wide IPA is a unique sort of Double/Imperial beer/ale, whose taste really sort of sets it apart from the Double/Imperial crowd in general. The body of the beer is somewhat thick, not thick, not medium thick necessarily but about 3/4 of the way between light and medium thick one might suggest. The taste is sweet, but underlies a sort of hoppiness if one will. The froth or carbonation of this beer, is sort of normal to somewhat more than normal in regards to Double/Imperial beers in general I would say. The ~squash colored froth bubbles out of the bottle upon opening it, and upon tasting it/smelling it, one senses a sort of pleasant sweetness that one does not normally get on first impression from a Double/Imperial style of beer/ale. Overall the taste, is perhaps somewhat reminiscent of a blanket of semi-sweetness covering a bundle of hoppiness. For, the sweet, pleasant flavor/aroma of this beer covers a sort of hoppy richness that is subtle, and not as demanding of one's attention as are some Double/Imperial style beers/ales. I would say overall that this is a very drinkable and pleasant beer. It might even be a good beer to have before casual athletic events like golf etc. for its sweet refreshing nature accompanied by it somewhat hoppy semi-thickness make it a very drinkable and refreshing beer.",5.0,Double-Wide I.P.A.,American Imperial IPA

This is my first beer review here. I just signed up! I've tried almost every brew on the craft market over the last 15 years and this one is it. Top notch! Would love to try it on draught if I made it to Colorado. Alright I'll give this a shot. Appearance: I love the label and the story behind it about the dog Arrow and all. Pours clean. Nice light amber honey appearance. It seems to have what you people refer to as soft lacing. You can't expect too much of a creamy head on a bottled beer unless perhaps it is bottle conditioned, rite? Smell: Well it's very ale like. I get the hops smell and some ethyl esters not unlike that reminiscent of a fine Tennessee whiskey. Oh it's beautiful. A very clean scent Yes there's some fruit there. A bit of piney mountain morning air. Gentle honey aromas. A little more pungency toward the bottom of the glass turning a bit skunky. Full character experience. Taste: The smoothest pale ale I ever tasted. Yahweh must have kegs of this brew upstairs with 'Arrow' waiting there to greet and lick your hands. I have a hard time describing the taste. Lemme lemon has to see if he can agree with some other reviews that were posted: Yes I get fruit and fermented malt sticky sweetness balanced out with a gently caressing ever so feminine bitterness which balances out the clean and refreshing clarity and uplifting sincerity of this exceptional brew. Mouthfeel?: It is beginning to feel increasingly difficult to review since I have polished off my glass. I might have to crack another, not as originally planned, just to be sure. I would say not heavy, but on the lighter side. If stout and porters are at a 10, and lagers pilsners are within the 1 to 3 range, this would take a five. Very pleasant and satisfying. Not too hoppy, not too malty. The brew is non astringent, that is it will not make you pucker up like a strong hoppy brew might. Nice way to cleanse the palate after something like a Ranger or Imperial IPA. I wish I could give more. You just have to experience it for yourself. It's really good. Overall: It just draws me in. Its a clear step definitive line in the sand as far as american pale ales go. I would classify it as definately a sessionable beer. I would buy this by the case if that was all that was available. I would like a keg of it for my birthday! The empty glass almost has a green or oolong tea like stinky-sweet smell that makes me think of other things I like. Overall just a really beautiful clean drinking round pale ale without that overbearing bitter bite and aftertaste I get from some pales. This pale has more color and easygoing friendliness.

I just wanna start out by saying WOW! it pours up a black color with a decent dark tan head. the nose is chocolate, roasted malts, subtle whiskey, some wood, subtle coffee. Oh my God! the taste is the same as the nose but with some very intense rye malt! big oaky flavor, too. full bodied, low smoothe carbo. Such an insanely nice brew!

40956,TexIndy,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a weizen glass. No freshness info but ummagum picked it up at the brewery last month so it's fresh. It was a completely cloudy yellow color with lots of carb streams. It had a 3 finger head that slowly settled into a constant, thick foam cap. Great sheeting with lots sticking. Not sure I could ask more from a hefe. The aroma was excellent. It's imperial so there is some alcohol esters in there but also a lot of clove and overripe banana like a std hefe plus some cinnamon and citric hops. Excellent sniffer. The taste was just as amazing. Has the traditional hefe elements like banana, wheat and clove and is well balanced with the citric hops and spice. I could drink this all day. Mouthfeel was medium with tickling carbonation and great aftertaste. Overall, an exceptional brew and right up there with their Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart. Highly recommend. This goes down smooth and with a ton of flavor. Not avail in here TX, dammit, but got one from ummagum. If avail near me, this would be in heavy, heavy rotation.

41012,JamesS,"Pours a great pitch black in color with a great tan (if bit small) head, and just a little bit of lacing. It has a wonderful scent, part coffee, part whiskey, part malt, part hop, a near perfectly balanced scent that ends with a sweet note, slighty more to the cocoa and bourbon side. Wonderful taste, the whiskey flavor is there, but not overly dominant like so many other such beers; it has a great slight coffee start with a wonderful dark, malty, old ale flavor, a nice sweet finish with a bit of hoppiness to tone it down. It goes down wonderfully smooth for such a bold beer, just a hair more bourbon in the finish that the 12. Absolutely freaking fantastic.",4.97,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 16,English Old Ale

42063,threeviews,"Poured from a 12oz can (multiple cans consumed b/w 7/13/14 & 8/30/14, Best By Date: 10/11/14) into a Rastal Teku 2.0 stemmed glass A- Pours a slightly hazy, golden yellow with a 1+ finger worth of a soapy white head with moderate retention. Being a fan of light-hued DIPA's, this a benchmark for the style and joins the ranks with other highly respected offerings in Enjoy By IPA and Founders Double Trouble. (5.0) S- Being that another oak-aged IPA in Burton Baton stands to be my favorite of all time (simply due to availability), Hop Crisis does not disappoint. Vanilla and coconut from the oak is at the forefront and blends beautifully with the hoppy notes of citrus (orange, tangerine, grapefruit) and tropical fruits (pineapple and mango). (5.0) T- Vanilla and coconut are the first to strike followed by a a quick shot of malt sweetness. However, the hops never play second fiddle and end up engulfing the palate into a dry citrus rind and piney finish. The 9.7% ABV (as labeled) goes absolutely undetectable thanks to the modest malt bill and a low percentage of residual unfermentable sugars. (5.0) M- The labeled 94 IBU's are tamed by the silky texture imparted from the oak spirals. Despite the 9.7% ABV, the body is as light as its appearance, treading the cusp between heavy/light bodied and light/medium bodied. (5.0) O- Simply put, this is perfection...and perfection in a can! Although I've had this before, I have been remiss in composing a proper review for Hop Crisis. Despite nearly a year passing since my last can, this is everything I remember (and perhaps even more). It possesses every quality of a world class DIPA (appearance, aroma, flavor, mouthfeel, high drinkability)...then add to that the time on oak spirals is what sets this one apart from the ranks. If it were more readily available, this would trumpet Burton Baton as my favorite DIPA (if not beers) of all time. Heady Topper...what's that?! (5.0) UPDATE: 2016 version (Best By 15 October 2016) is the best since I became privy to this beer way back in 2011. Not only did they update the hops, they also tweaked the malt bill. The new (and aggressive) hop varietals used somewhat trumpet the oak influence but the combination are a match made in heaven. The tropical, citrus and stone fruit characteristics along with the subtle vanilla and coconut imparted by the oak spirals is better integrated than the 2015 version which had a stronger oak presence and a much less interesting hop bill. This beer has varied from year-to-year and vintage 2016 stands to be the best of since its initial release in 2011...two words: Orange Creamsicle! Along with my original and proper review from 2014 (and my memory from the initial release back in 2011 which was a game changer for me), Hop Crisis maintains as my favorite DIPA and look forward to it every year. I just wish it was available year-round as its balance of hop bitterness, flavor and infusion of oak makes this a perfect 5 for me. Update: 10/08/2016 Cans are screened as ""Best By 10/15/2016"" and they are drinking wonderfully. Although the hop aroma is clearly fading (almost 4 months from canning), the vanilla and coconut aromas are revealing themselves with assertion. Although I wish the oak presence was stronger when ""fresh,"" the spoils of a DIPA almost ""past its prime"" is maturing into beautiful amalgam of flavors. If I can find some more lingering on the shelf, I will purchase, as this is a beer that will showcase flavors unimagined when fresh. I certainly don't advocating aging this beer in the proper sense...yet I think another month or two will afford the 2016 batch to morph into a much more flavorful DIPA. That said, if you want hops ""in your face"" then that ship has sailed for Hop Crisis 2016.",5.0,Hop Crisis,American Imperial IPA

T - The lavender really comes out in the taste, great wheat flavors and more orange than lemon on the palate. M - Light, but not thin, with plenty of carbonation.

42434,weareallfalafel,"Absolutely phenomenal saison! Enjoyed in a tulip glass. Poured from a 750ml bottle with no bottled on date, but I'm guessing based on how long this bottle sat it's just around a year old, give or take a couple months. Pours a hazy deep gold that radiates a little when held up to the light. The head is initially about 1- 1.5 inches, but falls slowly to a thin cap atop the beer while lingering a bit more on the edges and the sides of the glass. Smell is of Belgian yeast, rye bread, grassy hops, and a decent amount of funky Brett. The Brett character has increased with a little bit of age, and it adds a layer of funky complexity. The Brett and hops linger on the palate after swallowing, and they harmonize with the rustic grain and grassy character like a damn symphony throughout the beer. Balanced, but not restrained. Feel is soft and pillowy, medium in body, and helps to carry the flavor and aroma on the palate. Overall, I feel that I can't give this enough praise. It will always be one of the best saisons ive had, if not the very best. It's complex, yet very approachable to those inexperienced with rustic Brettanomyces brewed ales. The harmony of all the flavors and individual characteristics is unparalleled in American-made saisons. In my book, this is perfect. Almost brings a tear to my eye.",5.0,Saison Rue,Belgian Saison
42448,Mistofminn,"12 oz bottle from a Canis Major Mix pack. Bottle opens with a familiar hiss. Pours a pale amber color, doesn't really look like a typical Belgian Tripel to me. Does have quite a bit of tiny suspended sediments, and an ample carbonation. But the color looks like it belongs more to a pale ale than a tripel. Aggressive pour produces a one and a half finger head. The aroma is wonderful. Ah, this reminds me why I love Belgians so much! Fruity and yeasty, with a touch of cloves and spices. Typical Belgian Tripel taste. Yeast as well as fruit dominate, but cloves and spices kick it up to a whole other level. There is a little bit of bitterness that fits in completely with the rest of the flavors. Unexpected bitter aftertaste, but hey, just roll with the punches! Mouthfeel is light. Very crisp and very refreshing. I love Belgians, they remind me of sitting on the beach in the blazing sun, soaking in the waves and the sun, breathing in that summer air, and kicking back and relaxing with a nice Belgian ale. Excellent drinkability, as most Belgians have that effect on me. Another Flying Dog brew that I truly and whole-heartedly enjoy. Kudos, Flying Dog!",4.45,Kerberos Tripel,Belgian Tripel

Bouquet and flavor are very rich and complex. Sure there's a slight hint of basil but it's subtle. What I think their addition to the brewing really achieves is a sort of oppulent and rich mouthfeel not unlike that flavor pop you get from a bite of good pesto.

43217,WVbeergeek,"While listening to the Eels new album Hombre Lobo aka Wolfman. Appears a tarnished pink ruby hue over a musky amber brown background, the head is light colored white with a pink overcast. Fine speckled lacing coats my tulip chalice, oh so nicely. If you decide to pour the sediment into your glass, you'll be greeted by liquid apple butter but a few shades lighter with a khaki tint. Even the head turns a light beige brown. Aroma carries well with strong tart vinous layers of raspberry and mild vinegarette dressing, it opens up like a dry cider with additions of ripened raspberry preserves. Leathery oily components come through as well with wild barnyard funkiness from the brettanomyces. Layered complexities arise while continuing to sniff this brew which excites your brain of the possibilities that the flavor has to offer. Oak barrel aging effects complement the hell out of this beer with the funky brett and tart fruit combos, I'm loving the experience so far. Flavor initially strikes with a sharp layer of acidity and tart raspberry sweetness, with loads of extracurricular activity of flavor profiles joining the mix. Including the funk from the wild yeast additions, and I don't believe this alcohol content. There is no way this is nearing twelve percent alcohol by volume, or it the acidic nature outweighing the booze. I warn you it may induce cravings for proton pump inhibitors like Prilosec or Protonix after a few glasses but it's well worth it. Strong tree bark oak with a charred after taste hit along with the brett and acidic tart green apple and raspberry combo, what a quality level of complexity. Mouthfeel has been effervescent and prickly with acidity throughout the drinking experience, which carries the palate with each sip. Sweetness and bitterness collided with the yin and yang of raspberry sugar content and the resins from the oak barrel aging. Keep it up Weyerbacher bring the funk like no other, out of the American versions of sour ales or fruit infused lambics this has been the most outward mouth puckering version I've come across and I love sour ales. Drinkability is incredible for the alcohol and pure level of acidity that most beer drinkers aren't used to, but I enjoyed every sip. This is one of the beers I received at great discount on my birthday weekend. This stuff is pricey if you can even find it, the first time I had come across any of it was 22 bucks a bottle. I got mine around fifteen and that is well worth it. Overall excellent up there with the best of this style adventurous and extreme much like most of the works of Dan Weirback, again I hale from Weirton, West Virginia so I enjoy a good Weyerbacher every now and again. As I finished listening the album Hombre Lobo, it finished with ""Ordinary Man"" with a quote from the song ""I am no Ordinary Man"" that goes for any beer drinker who enjoys the works of Dan and company out of Easton, PA. Not for the mainstream but excellent craftsmanship to be enjoyed by those that appreciate the art of brewing.

Smell is cinammon with a touch of barley and malt. A small hint of acidity is apparent also. Taste is absolutely delicious. It fits in with the alt style but it is a bit smoother and more subdued than most of the altbiers I have tried. Somewhat of a fruity finish to it. The beauty of this is that these flavors are all just noticeable enough but never too overpowering. In my opinion, that is one of the main criteria of what makes a good beer. Very well done.

43456,boilermakerbrew,"A- Pours vigorously and violently after being a small gusher when opened, it is obvious that this beer was bottle conditioned. In the glass the beer is a light and bright yellowish-gold in hue with a big, frothy head. The head lasts forever and laces very well. The body of the beer is slightly hazy, which just adds to the glow of the beer in the glass. S- Grainy and dry wheat scents hit the nose first and provide an enticing impression. After the initial graininess, there is just a touch of tart that mixes in as well. At the back end of the sniff, the riesling grapes pronounce themselves in a delicate fruity scent reminiscent of the dry rieslings of France and Germany. T- This beer hits the tongue and largely follows the same flavor arc that its scent did. The beginning is light and dry with a good dose of wheat malt flavor. The tartness ramps up a little in the middle of the drink, but never gets very strong, just enough to know that it is there. The light tart note morphs into the grape fruitiness from the scent and here the riesling component is even more evident than in the scent. The grape flavors are light and dry and intermingle with just a touch of oak dryness before dancing off the tongue and down your throat. M- The entire time this beer is on the palate it is light in weight and fairly high in carbonation. Despite the relatively thin nature of the beer and light body, the beer drinks very smoothly. As with most all Berliners, the alcohol is nowhere to be found and it is a very quenching drink. Overall, this is a subtle, delicious, and brilliantly brewed beer. The addition of the riesling grapes mentioned on the label are tremendous and, in my opinion, make this a multi-season beer in a way that others of the style aren't.

43491,AndyAvalanche,"22 oz. bomber poured into a Duvel Tulip style glass. Liquid comes out extremely dark brown with deep amber to brown highlights on the side. Head is a bit smaller than one finger thick, lots of different sized bubbles, slight glass retention from the head. The color of the head is sort of a mahogany/black cherry color to dark brown. The liquid itself provides some glass retention. Smell is a huge malt bomb. Provides a dark, bitter chocolate smell, but not completely bitter. Some milk chocolate as well, even smells creamy, if that makes sense. Sort of a decadent chocolate sauce. Some dark coffee to espresso aromas as well, but sort of a back lash of it. The blend of all the aromas is absolutely great. Taste is just as good, as perfect as it gets. Like the bottle says, plenty of dark bitter chocolate. Super dark fudge and some dark grains somewhere in the mix. There is some sweetness as well, sort of like espresso with hints of sugar. Milk chocolate as well. I can't quite figure it out, but there's almost a bourbon flavor and I don't think this is barrel aged. Mouthfeel is perfect. Strong, full bodied. Great carbonation level, that's held up great since the aging. Smooth, creamy, thick to almost chewy mouthfeel, it's great. Hop presence detected in the mouthfeel. Great drinkability too, nice sipper, but way to easy to drink if you don't want to. On top of that, the value is perfect. I think this was like $7 when it was out as a seasonal.

43905,qdbfc,"22 oz bottle bought for $5 poured into a Imperial pint glass. A: Poured a thick head, clean white-beige in color, with above average retention, gradually declining to a thin cap atop the body. The alpine lacing was exceptional with strong spider webs on the sides of the glass. The body was fairly transparent, slightly hazy golden orange color, with the carbonation migration visible on the glass. S: Aroma is densely fruity, with mango, grapefruit rind, and cardamon-coriander like spices being readily apparent, resting on an appropriate Belgianish yeast (slightly Brettanomyces-like mustiness) and a some what earthy pepper-clove blend. , T: The overall flavor is a very tropical mix, very complex with some pineapple and mango characteristics being the most obvious attributes. Front of palate picks up the malt sweetness joined to earthy grapefruit rind. Mid-palate balances Belgian yeast, slight bit of Brettanomyces, mild hop bitterness, and very subtle malt sweetness quite well. Back of palate is pleasantly bitter, quite dry and not slick. Also as subtle as the malt, are the complex spice notes of coriander, cardamon, ginger and cloves. O: The Cali-Belgique IPA is an Americanized Belgian-style ale that I wouldn't necessarily recognize as a Stone beer. The hops are very toned down by their standards, but definitely contributes to many levels of complexity. D: As a disclaimer, the level of subtle-ness should calibrated with the fact I enjoyed a Oaked Arrogant Bastard along with Stones 16th anniversary IPA before tasting this great beverage.",5.0,Cali-Belgique IPA,Belgian IPA

T - perfection - probably atypical to a true Belgian lover but exactly what I prefer; balanced malt action with yeasty buttery notes that may be nutty and mildly peppery but mainly like a warm bath of the tropics with a side note of a breakfast cake or something perhaps of another world M - just enough lingering to beg temptation for more yet so complex as to force the palate to wait and contemplate D - give me more and more, the time needed to make notations is wasted in my need to get some more in my mouth - like a wet dream I can't imagine what it would be like to wait until 12/12/12 to try them all.

44283,RyanLaCount03,I really like this beer when I tried it in February or 2012. The smell of the beer had a really strong hint of nutiness. The taste was very good as well if you are a fan of a beer that is flavored as. The appearance was a dark brown or hazel.My friends also liked this beer.

44377,Mitchster,"$8.99 for a 6'er. Brewed with 2-row pale, carapils, dark chocolate malts, roast barley, and rye flake. Hopped with Willamette and Tettnang. 28 IBU's, 5.6% ABV. Pours out to a clear dark brown, forming a tall, stiff light yellow head with excellent retention and great solid sheets of lace. Very fine small layer of yeast in the bottom of the bottle. Carbonation is moderate. When I first smelled this, I thought, hrmmm...something spicy in here, and seeing as how it's a ""Winter"" ale, I thought, maybe nutmeg or ginger, but no, it's the rye. It's very subtle but adds a tremendous depth of character on top of the mild toasty malts and hint of lightly toasted grain husk. Wonderful nose. The mouthfeel is smooth and soft, nice and rounded with a light acidity and a clean finish. The taste opens up with a lightly hoppy carbonated acidity, followed by nuts, like toasted almonds with a lingering mild sweetness in the middle, finishing with a hint of caramel, and then this really nice mellow aftertaste of leather and tobacco. Infinitely drinkable. This has to be the single best brown ale I've ever had. There are layers upon layers of complexity, and it's exceptionally smooth, flavorful and drinkable. Not a single fault. Subtle and balanced. This, to me, defines a mild brown ale and what it should be. I am definitely gonna have to stock up on this while it's still around. Very highly recommended. I would give it all 5's if I couldn't imagine it was even better on tap.",4.8,Mild Winter,English Dark Mild Ale

44706,bdeck02,"In my hand now on a warm evening on the patio at The Old Monk in east Dallas. Sun is setting and beating on my back. This one happens to be offered up as a cask conditioned special on the menu. I love Left Hand, so I couldn't pass this up. Definitely love to see something possibly different than your one in a million IPA in that this is strictly an English style IPA. Served in DFH tulip glass. A - Hazy, sunset bronze. Translucent when help up to the setting sun. One large finger of dense vanilla milk shake looking head that may be disappearing at a turtle's pace. S - Like I stuck my head in a fresh bag of the freshest semi-wet herbal hops and sweet yellow cake batter... in that order. LUSH! Anyone who's ever held fresh, whole cone hops to their face would appreciate this one. T - Like no other IPA. It separates itself from the ubiquitous bunch. It's as though they carefully thought out and crafted every single IBU as though it were a brush stroke creating an artistic masterpiece in my mouth. The many colors of hop and malt brush strokes are thrilling! Even better as it warms closer to 50-55F. The 6.7% ABV is only noticed upon exhaling through the nostrils in a way that is subtle, exciting and whimsical. One the malt side of things, the Munich make their presence known and loved. Each malt can be detected in this one, which is not all that easy to do when crafting an IPA when the hops traditionally dominate. Base level sweetness is there from the Crystal and 2-row. The body is brought on by the wheat malt. Perfect malt profile. M - LUSH! Slightly snappy dry at the finish, however. Overall - You had better go to your local craft beer store or pub and snag this up before I do. If they don't have it, perform unmentionable favors for your local beer store guy in order to get some. Not sure what's so particularly English about this one other than the use of the Boadicea Hops which are relatively unknown other than they are named for a Celtic/England warrior queen.

The beer: shockingly pink when first poured, with a large foamy head. I must admit I was disappointed at first as I figured there was no way this was naturally brewed - boy was I wrong. Delicious blackberry/sour flavor on first sip, and its all 100% natural brewed. Blackberry syrup and food coloring this isn't. Taste only improves as the beer progresses: not only does this beer have great flavor, but boy is it smooth. You could drink this all night long, and that's pretty rare in the sweet/sour arena. I had to track down a second bottle the following week, and was shocked to find it was only $13 dollars.

A beautiful dark coffee color and heavy body just complete the picture. Not a beer to drink with food in my opinion. You need to sip and savor to truly appreciate it.

This is the review from the 2012: Bottle # 1472/4200 I genuinely love this beer in every incarnation that I've been able to sample - and I've had several bottles of each of the above listed years. I haven't noticed any bottle variation, this is great fresh and it ages (for at least 3 years) very well when properly cellared. Nose has a good amount of wood and booze when fresh and more of the malt comes to the front the longer it sits. The pour looks thin going into the glass, but there is a full tan head and robust lacing. The mouthfeel also does not reflect a 'thin' feel at all. Taste and mouthfeel compliment each other perfectly, a well-balanced stout that benefits from the barrel treatment and is in no way overpowered by the bourbon notes. A smooth, velvety entrance with no bitterness or booze at the end. This reminds me more of a Kate, subtle complexity and lighter, than a big in-your face -bal STOUT that is ever so popular. Perhaps one for the less-is-more file. A damn fine glass of beer. Big thanks to azaaron for the hook-up. I hope you enjoy your end of the trade as much. 5/5 across the board.

Not as spicy or barnyard as other saisons have been. Tastes awesome. Balanced, bitter like lemon peal in the end with just a little hop bitterness following. Theres a little pepper in the middle but in the front there's just a light wheaty lemon. Very refreshing yet complex. Mouthfeel is wet to start then drying in the end. Light to medium body with foaming levity that facilitates the latter flavors. Drinkability is, without question, one of the easiest 5s I've given. See above.

M: Crisp, dry, moderately carbonated, and refreshingly clean. D: Cigar City has hit the mark with this one. It reminds me more of a guava lambic than a fruited saison.

Sweet malt washes in on the first sip of this creamy beer and quickly turns into juicy red grapefruit flavors with a bittersweet finish. This beer is extremely drinkable. It's velvety smooth but has some lively bubbles and a full body with excellent balance on the palate. The beer is not overly bitter as the sweeter malts succeed in acting against the hops but both the dark, bready malt sweetness and the bright, fruity and floral hop flavors create a flavor greater than the sum of it's parts and the Black IPA is true harmony in a glass.",4.94,Yakima Glory,American Black Ale

I'm an average hard-working American whose Monday through Friday beer is Genesee Cream Ale (just one or two after I come home from work at 11:30 pm). On the weekends, I have two or three decent beers that I can fit within my budget. Here's my review of this beer: Bought from Warehouse Beverage in a 22 oz. bomber. Poured into a Guinness pint glass. Wow, this is probably the best beer I have ever had in my life! Looked like motor-oil. Very thin tan head. Not much carbonation. Unbelievable aromas of vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. EXTREMELY drinkable. Flavors matched the aromas I described above! Amazing that you don't taste the alcohol considering it's 9.4% ABV! The ONLY downside is that it was $13.99.

47776,kgrober,"To my knowledge this is the first farmhouse ale I've had the pleasure to drink. Poured into a pilsner glass, there was a nice 85/15 beer to head ratio. Wonderful graduated color, gold to burnt orange, bottom to top. Very effervescent with bubbles and particulate throughout the glass. The smell was very aromatic with citrus, lemony notes. A hint of spice, maybe coriander and/or orange zest. The mouthfeel was excellent rendering this brew very drinkable. I wish I had another to savor. A fantastic Summer brew, but welcome anytime I'm sure.",4.97,Helios (V Saison),Belgian Saison
47785,rickyleepotts,"Well it’s been a LONG time since we have drank a beer. It’s funny, I have been traveling so much we truly have not had time to drink. Well, we have time to drink, but as I always say, this projects lets us drink with a purpose. Anyway, we are back and we had some time this afternoon to write. (I say that as I am about to head to work!) Today we are drinking a Samuel Adams Double Bock. I have had Sam Adams (what I call them) several times, and their beers are always solid. But this one is part of their Imperial Series. I know that every time I drink an Imperial beer… I am always impressed. Anyway, this one is a Double Bock (following suit for a traditional doppelbock), a German style beer. Speaking of this type of beer, what is it with the goat? All of these beers have a goat on them somewhere. Oh well, let’s drink. In the Glass: In the glass, it’s thin and has a subtle head. You can’t really see through it, but it doesn’t appear to be that thick of a beer. If I had to say the color, I would say a penny… something with a deep copper color. The head, even when you swirl it around the glass, remains thin. Nose: This beer smells AMAZING. Oh man, this is one of the most powerful noses that I have ever smelt. It starts sweet, then ends with a bit of oxidation on the back of the nose. It smells wet, and you can pick up the hints of alcohol that this big beer (nearly 10% ABV) has in it. I am sure once I taste this beer, the alcohol will scream at me. Let’s see what this beer tastes like. Flavor: When a beer has a strong nose, it rarely follows up without the taste. This beer does. Oh man, the taste is amazing, and just as the nose changes on the front of the nose to the back, the flavors change as it goes from the front of the palate to the back of your throat. It starts fresh, and has an almost citrus flavor at first. As it moves back the palate, it becomes dark, smokey, and almost gives you a burnt caramel flavor by the time it finishes. Speaking of the finish, it lasts for a long time. The aftertaste (which I will get to) is consistent and lasts for a long time. Mouthfeel: The beer, in the glass, doesn’t appear to have a thick nature, but in the mouth it has a subtle thickness to it. Not molasses, but close. Considering how it smells, to how it tastes, I almost want to leave it in my mouth for a while. I can tell that the longer this beer sits, and the closer it gets to room temperature, the better this brew will taste. Aftertaste: It’s still there! I tell you, a good beer has a solid nose and a great mouthfeel. This beer offers all that, and has the taste to back it all up. This beer is one of the best beers I have had in a long time, and the aftertaste isn’t going anywhere. It’s a big beer, thick a thick IPA, and would go well with red meat or nuts. The aftertaste is thing, but it sticks around for a good three to five minutes after each drink. I bet this beer would be good on tap too. I have to say, this beer is amazing. I rarely rank a beer this high, but it’s one of the best beers I have had all year. I just had an Ass Kisser Double IPA… and this blows that out of the water. (The Ass Kisser is one of the most popular double IPAs on the market, and has won several awards over the years.) This beer smells great, tastes great, and leaves my mouth wanting more. I am thirsty after each drink, as it leaves the mouth dry… but who cares? It’s delicious, and I just want another drink! Bottoms up people.",5.0,Samuel Adams Double Bock (Imperial Series),German Doppelbock
47905,DirtybeerguyRI,"APPEARANCE: This fine ale fills the glass with rich, deep mahogany brown. The head is more of a light caramel. Very pretty beer! SMELL: You'll pick up on a lot of roasty malts with some mildly fruity (raisins perhaps?) notes. There's also a hint of chocolate in there, but this isn't a sweet beer. It's pleasantly understated. TASTE: The dominant taste here is a smokey black malt combined with hints of an earthy, roasty sweetness. This is an incredibly well-balanced rustic dark ale. The finish is just a hair tart, which is a plus. I wouldn't call this a complex beer, but it does a lot of good things in one ale. MOUTHFEEL: This is a very rich beer without being heavy. There's a mid-grade hoppiness, which provides a mild bite when it first hits your mouth. The loamy earthiness makes this the sort of beer that you'll want to savor with every sip. DRINKABILITY: This is a fine session beer. All of the nicely integrated flavors make this a very accessible brew. For food pairings, St. Botolph's will go with a wide range of dishes and palates. VERDICT: I've made my way through more than a few bottles of St. Botolph's Town. It's one of my favorite brews from one of my favorite brewers. I especially like its broad appeal. I've actually used St. Botolph's Town on a few occasions to introduce chronic Bud/Miller/Coors drinkers to the wonderful world of beers that taste like ... well ... something. If you see this on the shelf, buy bunches of it. Cheers, John Harvey Dirtybeerguy.com",4.95,Saint Botolph's Town,English Brown Ale

A laughter so inexplicable that I did a 360 in my Espia nylon office chair to confront the culprit. It was then that I looked down at the golden rivers and smiled. Not only did my balls tingle mid pour into my chalice, but i felt a sudden connection between myself in this captivating presence. I stand here today, a mere mortal, who has witnessed something extraordinary. I sunk my upper lip into the chalice and gently leaned back just as far enough so that it flushed through my mouth like a tranquil river. The laughter I was hearing began to intensify as I became fully aware of what was happening; magic.

T-It tasts GREAT. Like I said, I don't like pilsners, I guess this just might convert me because, the flavor of this one is outstanding. I don't remember if I gave any beers a perfect score, but for the style, this one deserves it, for real. Smooth pilsner taste with earthy, floral hops in the back to balance. A little detectable bitterness, but it's almost not there because of the cleanness of the bittering hop. M-And the mouthfeel. It is perfect! So creamy and smooth. It's not crisp, it's creamy, and for this style I can't get enough of it. SOooo creamy. It has a full medium body, very good. D-I could drink this all night long. It's so good.

48224,Zraly,"Bottled in 2011. Has been aging in a cool, dark room ever since. Poured into a DFH snifter glass. A deep dark earth color with a touch of tan head. When swirled, burnt orange hues dance along the sides of the glass. Nice lacing. I almost laughed out loud after a few sips. The finish on this is so chocolatey and so rich -- it tastes like a really rich chocolate cake. The hops have aged with this beautifully; the combination of the lip-smacking hops and the chocolate note under age is a real treat. Carmelized malts and toffee linger about, with rich rum-soaked fruit notes coming out as the flavor lingers. Sticky, candi sugar note. Full-bodied and alcohol with the aging is so well hidden -- I'm going to be a Flying Mouflan in a few moments. A fantastic dessert beer and great for a dinner-ending cheese plate.

49436,BuckeyeNation,"Burnished gold with a generous splash of orange juice. Despite fitting the entire beer into the pint glass on one smooth pour, there's only a barely perceptible yeasty haziness. No matter, the absolutely gorgeous cap of alablaster colored cream more than makes up for any slight visual shortcomings. Finely stenciled stripes of lace look amazing as well. This offering is a Belgian yeast-added version of Titan IPA, which is a fantastic beer to use as a launching point. It smells like there's more Euro hoppiness in this brew, which makes sense. It's primarily lemony, fruit peel musky and spicy. Right on the money for the style. Belgica Belgian Style India Pale Ale is the real deal. The hoppiness is almost up there with most good American IPAs... and if I had been able to drink it fresh rather than 5 months along, it might have been. Sorry, but the yeast can't be the only difference between this stuff and Titan. Belgian pilsner malt plays a secondary role (or is that tertiary?) in the flavor profile. That said, it contributes a sugary sweetness that is gangbusters in combination with the rest of the ingredients. Hops and yeast are the stars of the show. If this delicious and delectable ale was released in corked-and-caged 750s with 'brewed in Belgium' on the label, it would get much more love and respect. Top notes include candided lemon peel, sweet grasses, warm clove, cardamom and white pepper. Whatever yeast strain the brewers came up with is a certified killer-diller. I would hate to think they filtered out some of that flavor, but clear beer doesn't lie. Since plenty of it survived, no complaints here. When there's only one measly mouthful left to assess mouthfeel, you know that drinkability is stratospheric. The beer feels Belgianesque, which is the highest compliment that I can pay. It's silky smooth and has a sparkly sort of energy that is... well... perfect. I feel like a broken record sometimes when extolling the virtues of Great Divide. To cut to the chase, this is a world-class craft brewery and Belgica is a world-class Belgian-style IPA. Highly recommended.",4.6,Belgica,Belgian IPA

Smell: Sweet, citrus hops throughout, but just to the right degree. A touch of floral, perhaps herbal aromas peer through too. Taste: The beginning starts subtle and sweet with an herbal tinge along with presence of citrus hops; the middle carries the hops, but plateaus them with such brilliance which holds the flavor and bitterness to a perfection; the end just barely sweetens the flavor from the tone of the hops. A perfect parabola of flavors. Mouthfeel: Smooth, perfect carbonation, silky. Overall: When this brew hit seasonally, I was astonished by the artwork.

50764,woodychandler,"No kidding - one of my CANtacts laid this on me in a CAN during a recent visit! I CAN't believe that I am the first reviewer for this serving type, but it really does exist. I am not simply padding The CANQuest (TM) numbers - if I were to do that and got caught at it, I would be beyond ashamed. From the CAN: ""A hoppy homage to a Denver landmark - the Tivoli brewery""; ""Drink Up Fortuitous One""; ""Breckenridge Brewery - Fine Colorado Ales"". The Crack revealed a beer that was anxious to come out and play! It was filled nearly to the brim and an instant burble of light-tan head came right up and out. I like when my beer is exciting. Equally exciting was the aftermath of the Glug as I looked at two thick fingers of eggshell-white head with great retention. Color was a slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose was grapefruit-citrusy up front with a slight mintiness (spearmint) behind it. Oh sweet mercy, I have been jonesing for not just an IPA, but some CANned IPA and my prayers have been answered! Lucky ME! Mouthfeel was medium with an initial blast of citrusy hops accompanied by a caramel maltiness in the mouth. I began to think (again) of the Brach's Orange Caramels that my grandmother put out on the coffee table in my youth. In the meantime, the lacing began to appear and it was thick and sticky, perhaps requiring a jackhammer to get it off later. Finish was initially breathtaking in its hoppiness and cooled by the caramel flavor on the extreme finish. This was freakin' GREAT! Man, I would absolutely put some of these CANs in my cooler (if I could just find some). For those that may scoff at The CANQuest (TM) efforts, you might take a look at my scores for this in a bottle.

Produces a 2 finger off white head with outstanding sticky retention, as well as a semi perfect ring of sticky lacing. Left some bready looking particales on the bottom of my glass as well. Smells very very dry & herbal, spruce needles & tree sap notes flood the senses with only slightly less intense pineapple, over ripened plum, dates, cherry's & a bit of alcohol twang. Some zesty characteristics, and when it warms, a wonderful soft note of sugar roasted almonds/cashews become pronounced. Overall outstanding & intoxicating! Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of intense spruce needles, tree sap, semi pungent & very herbal hops! Following is sugary, candied dates, plum, with over ripened pineapple towards the finish. Finishes with burnt/roasted bitterness, dryness from alcohol, and a touch of molasses as it warms. All flavors linger very well & are very balanced, fruity, herbal, bitter, excellent! Mouthfeel is oily & sticky, thick & chewy, full bodied and it compliments flavor profile perfectly. Drinkability/Final thoughts - Words can not describe the rich, herbal, robust flavors of this heavenly brew. This brew immediately reminded me of Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous Ale, it's sticky, it's fruity, it's sappy & herbal, it's perfect for a chilly evening.

51631,JuicesFlowing,"Poured into a balloon glass. The beer is a Cherry Ruby Amber. That's what I'm calling it. Beautiful frothy cream head that leaves chunks of bubbles and sheets of sticky lacing in it's wake. The aroma is of faint fruit notes with a delicious sweet caramel warmth. The taste is so complex. This beer has a sweet fruity beginning with delicious cherry notes. This gives way to a more typical caramel malt body found in marzens. The beer finishes with a nice woody, cinnamon spiciness to fill out a complex taste profile. Mouthfeel is crisp, bright, slightly dry, and extremely refreshing. Overall, I cannot believe this surprise. For starters, it's a sneaky Oktoberfest, since it's labeled as a Rye Lager.

Strong notes of roasted malt, followed by dried stone fruit, such as raisins, prunes and figs. I also get notes of vanilla, candied sugar-like sweetness, and a touch of Belgian yeast funkiness.

53132,jerlleutz,"I actually drank this twice in one day, once off tap in a Bruery tulip, the other at home out of my growler, into a narrow mug. I'll review the growler as I felt it was better. Overally, I love the Bruery's productions, but my one blackmark I'll give them is overcarbonation in their bottle pours. Their taps and subsequent growler fills seem to overcome this. I presume the bottling requires a bit more carbonation to deliver the punch. So the appearance was very black and copper, and actually somewhat clear for a beer of its flavorful heft. I would be OK with a denser visual in this situation. In a tulip, it looked even lighter. The smell is rich and malty. There is a darkness to this one, and it reminds me of waterlogged timber--highly arousing. It tastes rich and Scottish, like ancient barrels and the forests' moss of eons past. There are some fruit highlights. It is heavier than it looks and a joy to throw back, whether in a tulip or a mug.",4.97,Rugbrød,Rye Beer

As I drink and the level descends, I do appreciate the consistently clinging lace that follows me as I follow the brew down the glass. It leaves a rough mapping, a constellation of small isles, pasley plumes, arrayed about like sweet reminders of yesterhour. S: Marmalade, sourdough dough. Hops out at you though. T: Super snappy tang, dang! Followed by apple, okra, what the fuck is in this delicious brew? Takes a few sips to discern. There is some hefty hoppyness, where am I now? This is transformative, and I love the Bruery for their ability to transport. Grapefruit peels, M: Jumpy jive juice, why 45 F degree juice? I need to let it warm to get everything. But I understand .... D: Oh yeah. Can I have this every day? I would for a while like a heroin habit. But it would be wise to kick. I wish all those IPA creators would listen to this brew, taste it and realize that there are more than 2 dimensions in the perceivable universe.

Pours out of the bottle a nice reddish color with a small head on top that receded into some nice side glass lacing and really just looked the part from the beginning. Rich aroma of tart cranberry mixed with hints of cinnamon spice and nice touches of brown sugar. Warming really brought out the fruit though as the rich cranberry aroma and flavor dominated everything around. Warming brought some nice light notes of brown sugar, nutmeg, hints of cinnamon and a really nice just fruit pie like flavor to it.

53899,Pahn,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Bottled July 29, 2011, drank August 29, 2011. Appearance: Free pour yields a 3 inch fluffy white head that dissipates slowly and rockily, leaving sheets of lacing that lasts as long as the beer in the glass. Crystal clear light golden, lots of lacing. Perfect. Smell: Pungent citrus and tropical fruit, with a pleasant malt background (toasted white bread). Lingering ripe melon and apricot aroma along with a little bit of initial dank grapefruit... really beautiful. Floral quality comes out with warmth. I picked this beer up because I'm considering using Nelson Sauvin hops in an upcoming homebrew with morningthief. Needless to say, the aroma of this beer is telling me to go ahead and pick up some Nelson Sauvin. Taste: All the hop notes from the aroma pop up in the taste, but while they're bold in the nose, they're profoundly refined and subtle here, forming a great balance with the just-prominent-enough malt backbone, both of which work great with the slightly creamy, fuller-than-expected mouthfeel. Malt is like crackers and sourdough bread, with a little toasted fresh white bread and some ""stick your head in the pale malt bucket"" at the homebrew shop like fresh NEBCO Gold Stock. While the grapefruit and melon are present, the more dominant hop flavors have more of an orange and herbal character. The overall balance is masterful and delightful. The aroma advertises huge hops and enhances every sip, while the actual flavors, bountiful as they are, show a sort of muted restraint that reminds you that ""American pale ales"" don't need to be IPAs by another name. As always, I hate to give out 5-for-taste lightly, but this beer is spot on for the style, and I love the flavor. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Creamy, but juicy (""wet"") enough to remain refreshing and appropriate. Moderate carbonation. Semi-dry finish that works great with the toasted flavors. Overall: I don't know if it's because Anchor is such a fixture in American beer that it's overlooked, or that people don't appreciate a good thing when they find it, or that Nelson Sauvin is a love-it-or-hate-it hop, or that people aren't drinking this fresh, but I can't see how this beer averages below A. It is near perfect in every category. I bought this just to get a feel for the hop varietal, but ended up finding a beer that should be a staple in my fridge for a month or so after it's released. This beer is outstanding; tons of different flavors without being at all in-your-face, excellent balance, really refreshing, looks great, stinks of potent, fruity hops... what more can you ask for from an American pale ale?

""A Malty, Robust, Jobless Recovery Ale"" well I have a good friend and Army Reservist out of work, so people keep talking recovery and I have plenty of friends out of work. So heres to you oh tall and bald. This beer is a very hoppy brown ale. The malt comes through with the hops and it is no disappointment. Well ballanced but NOT overpowering. the 7.83A% ABV is enough that 2-3 of the 1 pint 6 oz bottles will put you over the legal driving limit so it is no light weight. the 64.20 I.B.U. is enough to please most hop heads.",5.0,Wilco Tango Foxtrot,American Brown Ale

56761,Budinetz,"Poured at 55 degrees F into an oversized snifter. Aged roughly 5 years, as this was a limited, one time, release. Pours an opaque black color with a khaki colored head that dissipates slowly. Decent head retention, and beautiful lacing all around the glass. Color is like an onyx black...seems to stretch beyond the SRM scale. Smells of roasted barley, caramel and crystal malts, with a slight hint of coffee bean. Amazing nose overall! Tastes of divine roastiness, with a touch of bitterness from the hop balance. Flavor is pretty awesome, and the beer has mellowed out after 5 years of aging. Definitely more malt forward, but you still have a nice bitter finish. Feels slightly prickly on the tongue with a slickness on the finish.",5.0,30th Anniversary - Fritz And Ken's Ale,American Imperial Stout
56842,beholder_pl,"One badass beer. Appearance: Nice, a bit hazy amber in colour with a yellowish, thick head that lasted very long. Aroma: Most double IPA's I've tasted had a very sweet or alcohol aroma, but not this one. Amazing hoppy, citrusy aroma from the bottle and even better from the glass. Very intense. Taste: Extreme hoppy bitterness, little bit of caramel, resin and earthy flavours. Tons of citrus. No alcohol aftertaste, just how I like it. Mouthfeel: soft carbonation, medium to high bodied. Overall: Never have I tasted an IIPA so amazingly good. Best IIPA I've ever had and probably one of the best beers I've had so far. Enjoyed from a teku glass.",4.96,1000 IBU,American Imperial IPA
56875,Justin23060,Everything about this beer screams quality. The color is a slightly orange golden with a perfect tall off white head that lasted and clung. The smell is mild citrus mixed with that classic Belgian aroma that is not at all over powering. The taste is again citrusy hop and malt. Finished just about in the middle of sweet and dry The bottle promises perfect balance and they have delivered on the promise. There is a slight alcohol warmth too that adds to the medium body of the mouth feel. One of my new favorites. I think this will be on the table for Thanksgiving dinner.,5.0,BPA,Belgian Pale Ale

57110,Sabtos,"Huge, super fluffy, marbleized brown and black whip cream thick head atop a licorice black liquid. This pours almost as if it is on nitro, but the colors are exactly the opposite of uniform and bland, and the aroma makes it extremely evident that it's not on nitro. Huge walnut and roasted coffee aromas come off the nose. There are super walnutty, roasted coffee, chocolate, and extremely flavorful malt characteristics just bouncing around everywhere. Frog absolutely kills it with this brew. This is not overly bitter on the coffee notes. It's very well balanced. Unbelievable. Once you get it on your tongue, even without swirling it around, an immensely creamy, almost pudding like texture comes through that is just absolutely sublime, so delicate yet so damn rich. This is one of the softest, yet densest most luscious brews I've ever felt. And it doesn't hurt that it's absolutely delicious. Some might fault it for it's high alcohol content, but that's totally undetectable, at least to me. This beer is effing perfect. --- Due to a similarity in brewing ethics and a love for the darker side of styles, I thought it fitting to do a side by side with two of my favorite unadulterated stouts, DORIS and Marshal Zhukov, which I was finally able to do early 2017. Zhukov is a little sweeter like there's chocolate cherry, maybe some cedar or wood. One person did mention soy sauce. DORIS is more roasty, chocolatey and nutty. When they warm Zhukov has more licorice and molasses, while DORIS is hoppier with pine, cedar and even lime...? Not the primary flavors/aromas, but just the little notes that set them apart from each other. Conclusion is unanimous: these are both two righteous beers. --- In mid-July 2017, I opened a 2010 and 2013 bottle on the same night. While I was not surprised by these results--they were still quite impressive. Both beers held up and were insanely delicious, without a hint of the normal notes you usually get from old, lesser stouts like the staleness of cardboard, molasses, raisin, or others whatsoever. Both were a little more airy, yet still intensely roasty. While the '13 was more chocolatey and sweet, the '10 was more nutty, with a lot of coffee notes, really coming across like rich mocha ice cream. The '13 was smoother in body while the '10 was more balanced and less sweet, but also had less carbonation.",5.0,D.O.R.I.S. The Destroyer,Russian Imperial Stout
57202,MV_CHI-NS,"Note: Bottle of 2011 'Pepe Nero' Appearance: Licorice/bistre head with slight maroon/burgundy shading when held up to the light, with an ecru/chocolate head. Aroma: Profound notes of raspberries and blackcurrants with a wine-like nose (like a lighter Bermet) Taste: The taste with this one comes in two stages: a. The raspberries and blackcurrants come through, making this akin to a lambic. b. Spicy pepper and roasted chocolate. The first thing to hit you is the fruit, which is quickly followed by notes of spicy pepper and roasted chocolate which linger on the palate; truly, not what I would expect from a saison - black or not. Mouthfeel: Light, almost creamy mouthfeel with a 'peppery' tinge resolve. Overall: As a fan of saisons, I had high expectations of Pepe Nero - particularly because it is a black saison; I can say with certainty, those expectations were exceeded. The aroma and taste threw me off at first because 'fruit' and 'chocolate' are not terms I would associate with a saison, but this has easily become on of my favorites.",5.0,Pepe Nero Belgian Style Ale,Belgian Saison

57908,DavidS333,"Southern Tier 2xIPA is an American Double/Imperial type of brew. Its froth is light on a scale of light/med/thick. Its color is like a sort of darker rose champagne, and is really beautiful, it looks sort of surreal when you look at it in a clear glass, sort of ""holographic"" almost. It looks like a yellow beer with a red tint, very cool. Its smell is also unique, its one of the only sort of froth-less beers I've had recently that smells almost like bubblegum. Its really a unique and curiosity invoking smell. The body is surprisingly light given the lack of froth. And is closer to light, but between light and medium on a light/medium/thick scale. This is really a sort of ambrosial Double IPA. Its a strong beer, but it doesn't have a lingering alcohol bite. Instead of a hop shell I would describe this beer as having a sort of thin beta hop acid shell, surrounding a full and rich hop tinged flavor. The aftertaste is stronger in the middle of the tongue in regards to hoppyness, and overall it is a very light and drinkable American Double/Imperial. This American Double/Imperial is perhaps somewhat uniquely flavored by the malt varieties that are added to the beer. It is really quite unique and refreshing, and if one is looking for the muscle-relaxing qualities of an American Double/Imperial but for a more floral/malty take on said tradition I would suggest to you that you try this beer. This is a great Double/Imperial in that it stakes its own claim and stands by it. It is a unique beer in this category and stands its ground in this space, proving to the drinker that different can still be very good. Overall this beer is the sort of beach-sunset of Imperial Doubles and its drinking is definitely a pleasing experience.",5.0,2XIPA,American Imperial IPA

58482,WVbeergeek,"Appears a beautifully clouded copper orange hue with a thick chunky doughnut like cream tinted white head, has some yeast specks floating on board. Lacing is perfect fine Belgian style lacing evenly strong around my glass. Aromatics offer up floral hops with citrus components joining in, mildly spiced yeast notes with fresh baked bread in the biscuit malt department. Very soothing and delicious smelling brew from Weyerbacher. A superb blend of flavors collide with cookie dough like malt and sweet bread layers with yeast spicing the party up a bit. Finishing with mildly earthy, pungently citric, and pleasantly floral hop additions. A bit of undeniable Belgian funk going down brings it all together. A perfect blend of spiced bready hoppy ale sits in my glass very well done the most finesse to come of Dan Weirback in some time. Mouthfeel is so smooth carbonation bubbles to tickle a bit but overall the balance of malt and hops streaks so nicely across the palate, quite the interesting medium bodied Belgian style pale. Leaves traces of yeast spice and bittering hops on the palate, and hop burps will follow and tickle the nose. Drinkability overall kicks ass one of those OMFG beers that inspires me to try as many beers as I can. A case of this is in my near future I have to sit on these and watch them evolve, the best American brewed belgian style pale to cross my palate reminiscent but by no means a copycat of Orval Trappist.",5.0,Verboten,Belgian Pale Ale

I also got some bready yeast, and a decent amount of delicious smelling floral hops. I was definitely excited to try the beer. The mouthfeel delivered!

But Uinta's high alcohol beers can stand up to anyone's. My first reaction when I tried this beer, in a bourbon barrel version, was simply ""Wow."" It had great taste and great subtlety (for a barleywine ale) and the bonus of the bourbon barrel. Should all my beers be so powerful and profound. In appearance it is a dark brown, with little lacing. The smell is beer with a little fruit in front of it -- not too strong an alcohol nose. The taste is a malty front with a bourbon barrel back; the hops bite is there but is subsumed by the malt and the bourbon (to me, an ideal proportion).

There is also some sweetness hidden in there as well as citrus zest.

You take a smell and yup they sure do. You get that grapefruit. herbal, tea and some pine hops with the grainy sweetness from the malts. The taste is exactly like this with the flavor rolling across your tongue just like any quality IPA with that herbal piney grapefruit taste with some tea like tasting hops coming from the Noble hops they use. It leaves you with that sweet German pilsner malt that you'd find in quality German beers and then ends with the herbal, tea, grapefruit and piney hop bitterness that almost reminds me of a bit toned down version of a West Coast IPA mixed with Noble hops. The smell and taste of this beer is so amazing for a Pilsner that they should literally send this to any of the big 3 breweries just to let them know what a real one can taste like... do they even know? I can't see how they don't. This beer reminds me of the Prima Pils by the Victory brewing company very much actually. I like this better though because its a bit more complex and has a thicker and creamier mouthfeel. Dogfish can really brew their ales but this proves they know how to really brew a lager just as well. Amazing mouthfeel doesn't feel light at all and the 7.5 alcohol is covered up as much as possible for a lighter pale beer. It's covered up so well and you don't that typical beery alcohol yeasty taste you'd get from most lower quality pilsners.

64089,MadeInOregon,"I saved my 750ml bottle of Infinium for 3 months waiting for a celebratory moment and one came last week. So, since I was pretty in-the-dark about this beer when I acquired it, I checked out all the info on the Boston Beer Co.'s website and read a few reviews on here. Feeling pretty prepared I popped the cork... THE BODY is awesome. Poured into a champagne flute, the color appeared identical to Veuve Clicquot champagne which I was fortunate to enjoy a couple weeks prior--in other words, this looks like fine champagne! Infinium has an absolutely incredible bubbly foam head indicating a super effervescent brew, like a trippel. THE SMELL is very floral and citrusy, along with some hints of cotton candy, yeast and a bit of sour hops. THE TASTE is very crisp and tart like a green apple, but mixed with some qualities of a good pilsner. The finish is very dry and yeasty, very much like a trippel. Overall, I will say that Infinium has the skunky, yeasty qualities of a trippel combined with the crisp, tartness of champagne, and the hoppyness of a pilsner. This is an incredible beer!!! THE FEEL is champagne, straight up. It is slightly heavier, but not by much. In conclusion, this beer is incredible. It is very drinkable and well balanced in every respect. It feels good from nose to stomach. It is worth the hype and worth the price, so it is sad to me that so many reviewers want to turn up their noses for silly, snobbish reasons, rather than enjoying an amazing beer. This is the highest score I have given to any beer, and the Boston Beer Company has earned it. Infinium, it's been a pleasure!",5.0,Infinium,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut

66037,thebrood1987,It pours very nicely with an amazing ruby reddish brown color to it. Amazing smell for a scotch ale that isn't hopped up. I get all the typical smells of bready chocolate toffee and caramel malts but they are very rich smelling and I also get a noticeable sweetness and almost a soy sauce in the smell. I also get some of the alcohol on the smell and some subtle spicy earthy hops. The taste is just like the smell pretty much with amazing rich malt tastes but with an actual sweetness that compromises the whole body of the beer. You get a slight spicy earthy hop on the back end which pops up there at the last minute after the attack of rich malty sweetness. Definitely not too sweet at all but it almost has a chocolate malt or milkshake taste to it as well. Not to say it stout like though in taste. You do get a little bit of that soy sauce taste that you get in the smell. I'm sure this is from all the malts and thick body coming together. It tastes awesome though and definitely isn't a bad taste at all.

67556,TheHoppiest,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip class. This is brought to me by some good friends in Wisconsin. It is the last of my four pack, so I thought it high time to review it. Pours a hazy mango color, like the color of mango nectar. While it is light-colored, it is almost opaque. Has a half inch foamy white head which reduces with a soap-like consistency. Has a very fruity aroma, with loads of orange citrus, pineapple, mango, and an airy floral nature that really makes this standout. You could get lost in how good the smells. After such a wonderful aroma you hope that the taste won't let you down, and thankfully, it does not disappoint. Sweet and mualty upfront, with mild fruit and hints of caramel, this ends with a pleasing bitterness leaves you wanting more. Hints of resin are there to remind you of the strength of this brew. The medium mouth feel, very smooth and easy drinking, ending with a bit of bitter to nip at tongue. An excellent DIPA, it is a real disappointment that New Glarus is not sold in the Cleveland area.

Beer was golden in color and left great lacing while drinking. The overall appearance reminded me of Pliny the Elder. The smell was absolutely exceptional. The aroma literally smelled like a fresh bag of hop pellets. I have never encountered this before in any ipa or double for that matter. There was loads of pine, citrus and weedlike notes in the aroma. Taste was piney, grapefruit citrus with an oily resin texture that finished dry (WEST COAST to the bone). An extraordinary double IPA.

Aroma:Very complex, can smell the roasted malts, coffee and cocoa, with a discernible sweetness lingering in there. Taste: Starts off with a bittersweet taste of the belgian yeast, brown sugar, cocoa. Fairly light tasting for a stout, but still very complex. Finishes off with a long lingering coffee cocoa hops taste. Very delicious. Mouthfeel: Fairly thick, but lighter than I was expecting. I would describe it as medium for a thick imperial stout standard. This is the only shortcoming to me for the beer. Still very satisfying. Overall: A very good beer, probably one of my favorites to date. It has a worderfully bittersweet taste to it that lingers for a long time, very complex, good mouthfeel.

S - Pick up smells of sweet dark choclate and faint alcohol, stronger bourbon scent as it warms T - Wow, what a treat! Rich, creamy and smooth sweet choclate with roasted malts. I don't really pick up any citrus from the orange, but the sweetness from the oranges seems to be mixing with the choclate masking any bold cirtus flavor. Slight, slight hint of chile on the back end along with roasted malts. No overwhelming alcohol from the bourbon, it is hidden really well and mellow. M - Perfect for a porter, full with lots of carbonation. Maybe too much carbonation for some, but perfect for my taste. O - Easily my favorite offering I've ever had from Deschutes, truley a world class beer. The flavors play off each other really well.

(It looked like a choco-volcano being poured) smelled like chocolate biscuits and tangy cherry fruit. Hint of Roasty malts too. Since I had a small glass I waited a few minutes for it to warm up and let the flavors mature. Bittersweet chocolate dominates the palate from the start but the warm vanilla and tart cherrys follow. Mouthfeel is amazing, so rich and creamy with good carbonation. Hardly a trace of alcohol . If it seemed like I used the word chocolate a lot in this review its because theres no other way to emphasize the robust cocoa flavor packed into this behemoth.

72138,brewdlyhooked13,"Appearance - pours black. Looks opaque at first but if held right up to a light, it has some deep and intense ruby hues. Two fingers of chocolatey mocha foam with nice stick as it melts down. Aroma - spicy grapefruit, almost juniper-like. Some char to the roasty grain aroma. Taste - the sweet malty grain has a roasty element to it, but you better find it and enjoy quickly. The hops hit heavy, hard, and with intent. Wow, a rush of pine and grapefruit rind, a total alpha wash but little if any medicinal factor for a hoppy brew that could easily go there. The swallow brings in some balancing roasty malt and some abv heat. Not much indication that this is double-digit strength. The finish is a palate scraping bitterness, dryness occurring from the hops and the black malts. Lots of lingering flavor here, no need to rush the bottle. Mouthfeel - my first impression was smooth like a milk stout or RIS but this got modified as I progressed to a lighter but still smooth feel.

S - Perfect marriage and balance of hops with both an English and a Pacific West feel. Kinda like a piney brown. T - Malt sweetness really carries the strong hop. The thing that really makes this work is the use of Goldings to match and balance the pine. A pleasant roasty, slightly smokey, malt is hiding just below the hop. Ends right in the middle of sweet and bitter. M - Just about perfect. Mild sharpness gives way to a creamy finish. Nice linger. O - I probably wouldn't have bought this had I known it was an American Black... but this has made me reverse my opinion of the style. Up until tonight, I thought the concept of an American Black was weird and awkward. Too much one way or the other and you get ""just awkward"" My few bad experiences with this style reinforced that opinion. I honestly think this is what the style was meant to be.

It smells reminiscent of their Latitude 48 but with a fruity melon and resinous twist to it from the hops they use. I also get a little bit of a spruce pine smell as well. This is a very smooth beer with the fruitiness right up front along with that melon taste just unveiling itself and then the sweet roasted caramel malts follow and then ending with the fruity citric piney herbal and spruce bitter finish. It tastes like an earthy resinous very deep and rich flavored hoppy IPA all in one. It has a variety of complex hop flavors like I said ranging from melon and fruits in the beginning to a very nice herbal spruce pine finish. Its a perfect combination of the 2. It has a sweet silky body and mouthfeel and really in my mind matches up with a lot of the top notch DIPA's that I've had. I love that you can't really taste the alcohol from this but can kinda sorta feel the heat in the throat just a tad. Other than that the alcohol taste is masked by the fruity melon hop tastes. Its like their Latitude 48 just with a more complex hop taste. Get this beer it proves Samuel Adams can make a more complex beer than a lot of people give them credit for and honestly in my opinion stands with the best IPA's I've tried from the West coast and East coast.,5.0,Third Voyage Double IPA,American Imperial IPA

75013,OStrungT,"This beer pours a mohogany color with a thin but fluffy brown head. the head fades slowly, leaving a decent lacing. This beer has a great aorma. I get vanilla up front with some chocolate. I detect some bourbon as well. Sweet caramel and roasted malts mix in. All the aromas are mild and blend well. This beer tastes just like it smells. So well blended. Caramel, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon. This beer is amazing. The beer is smooth and full bodied. Carbonaton is low, fitting the style. The alcohol is well hidden throughout this beer. This beer might make a decent session beer, but with a 12.5% ABV, I wouldnt recomend it. Overall: This beer is a great beer. I decided that I couldnt think of a better day to drink it than on the eve of the first annual Firestone Walker Invitational Beer Fest. Hopefully they have it on tap tomorrow.",5.0,Firestone 15 - Anniversary Ale,American Strong Ale
75086,CA_Infidel2o9,"Poured from a bomber to a Tulip A- ruby red, 1/2"" quickly fading off white head S- intense spicy peppers that tingle the nose, southwestern style sweet salsa T- follows the nose, hint of belgian yeast M- medium body, crisp carbonation, tingling spicy peppers at the back of the throat O- the first beer i have ever aged and i'm extremely happy i did. I don't remember much from last year besides that the peppers were very subtle and really only showed as a spicey after taste and heat. With over a year on it, the peppers have dominated everything. The best description i can give is basically a beer with clamato in it (try it, it's awesome!) With a southwestern twist. It's spicy, its sweet, and earthy.

Apricot; the typical IPA aromatic sweetness; floral hops; and no malt. Taste - A little sweetness at the beginning, and a mild hop bitterness.

But I personally like that once in a while, and this one is still pleasant despite it’s strength. You can definitely taste a bit of whiskey and maybe some tobacco.

82578,rajendra82,"Golden, clear body, and the vigorous carbonation streamers rising up from the etched nucleation site at the bottom of the Duvel tulip glass gave this beer an attractive appearance. The smell of brett induced funk mixed with green apples, honey, and lavender was very intoxicating. The taste provided everything promised by the smell, and then some. The palette was dry like a saltine cracker, with an initial sour apple and herbal flavor, that transitioned into white pepper, honey, and coriander. The finish had a hint of cheese from the aged hops and then faded into a cider like aftertaste. The funk of Brett was there, but did not overpower.

88429,Rumpole,"Found this in a 12-pack on its own, not part of a mix-pack. Rich amber color, thick white head; looks lovely. Aromas of pine and citrus. Strong hop flavor, more pine and plenty of citrus. A bit out of balance on the hop side, but that's not a tragedy. Smooth drinking throughout no matter the strength of flavor. Clean finish. Really remarkable. What we have here is a straight 5% abv lager with a little extra malt and a lot extra hop. This fills a badly needed hole in the market, one of long standing, namely having that IPA hoppiness without the attendant IPA keister-kicking that you get when quaffing 7% and on up. Strongly flavored, but ""sessionable"", as they say - meaning you can drink in mass quantities with relatively less subsequent punishment. I've since learned that others have already come up with a similar brew, especially on the West Coast. I'd be interested to learn what they're charging for the pleasure. The usual Sam Adams retail in glamorous Worcester, MA is around $15 or thereabouts for a 12-pack. By no means is that cheap, but I imagine it'll be tricky to find something else this strongly flavorful yet easy to drink for that price. We'll see. The Rumpole budget usually precludes beer in that range, but this stuff is so good that adjustments might need to be made. Well done, Sam old egg. This one's up there with the dear old Noble Pils, which ought to be returned to the 12-pack format too.

90410,DavidS333,"New Belgium Rampant Imperial IPA is an original sort of Double/Imperial and is quite refreshing. The smell of Rampant Imperial is quite light, with more energy springing forth in the form of the beer's medium to to slightly more than medium froth per se. The taste of the beer is quite unique. Though it is somewhat light at first, perhaps in keeping with the beer/ale's somewhat light-to-medium body(of a light amber color), the hoppsyness is somewhat more centered around the middle of the taste, where one really gets a taste of that sort of tasty tip-of-the toungue hops presence, that fills out towards the back of the mouth per se. Overall its not too bitter or heavy in regards to what one might be used to in regards to Double/Imperial beers/ales, and hence it is all the more perhaps refreshing and drinkable in quantity per se.

I have been tracking W00tstout on the Stone website and buying some for the winter. Never done anything like this before. I have about 150 bottles at home that I got in north North and Central Alabama. FYI there is a keg of the 2018/11.5 ABV in Huntsville as of Sept 18th 2018 (See Untapped, Das Stahl Bierhaus) that they found or just brought out. Before that it has been sold out around here for the last several weeks. The last place that had any draft was ""Wish You Were Beer"" at campus 805 and that was what they call the W00tstout 4.0 I think because it was 13% ABV. That ran out about three weeks ago. What I started out to post about before I got sidetracked is, of the bottles I have, occasionally I open one that has a metallic taste. I always tried to put purchases that were made cold into the fridge the same day. I bought many six packs cold and warm, and two cases warm over the last three months and I did not track every bottle. I did buy a chiller fridge even though they are high ABV. I got paranoid about them cellaring. I'm just wondering if the ones I open that have the metallic taste initially, (it goes away either in mind or with time in the tulip glass), is due to having been bought cold and allowed to get warm. Never really warm. All cold purchases were brought home in a cooler bag. I'm really OK about the occaisional bottle with an initial metallic taste but I think about if Im trying to introduce one of my brothers or firends to the nectar of the Gods, and the metallic taste is their first impression. Clearly not the end of the world. Anyway I am so enjoying this beer! Trying to branch out. Trying lots of different beers, so suprised I like beer after giving up on it years ago.

Anyone that has read my reviews knows Pumking is my favorite ale ever, of course maybe second to Rochefort 10, or maybe Pumking is my favorite, depending on the occasion or my mood. So finally I got a bottle of this being it is finally in season.... so here goes nothing.... Look: After cracking open the bottle, I got a mega wiff of pumpkin. Candied pumpkin. But I am not rating smell right off the bat, just noting how RADIANT the smell is! I expected Pumking, but silly me. This stuff came out DARK. Like motor oil. Well, darker. It's muddy dark brown. I like it. Same head as pumking. About 2 finger that lingers for a few minutes. But oh the smell! The look though is quite beautiful. And once the head disappears it turns BLACK. Really black. It is evil looking, and perfect for halloween! Smell: THE SMELL! The moment I cracked her open, I got a blast of that sweet pumking goodness! I can't wait to sip this now. She is ice cold from the fridge and poured into a goblet. I have been waiting to try this since last year, mind you, just never found a bottle when I was wanting one. But the smell... heavy sweet candied pumpkin with hints of black licorice. This is so Halloween its not even funny. This is your ideal Halloween ale! Get yourself some of this for Halloween, seriously! Taste: YOW. That is powerful. Pumking exists in here, but its different. It has a darker flavor, I detect some darker presence, maybe some hints of licorice, some flavors I can't pick up on. Definitely pumpkin, cloves, butter, pie crust, cream, then the other flavors. The best way I can describe it is Pumking with essence of the bottle of the trick or treat bag. Outstanding. And it has some alcohol burn being its 10% alcohol, so she is a lot stronger than Pumking. Be careful! Feel: Smooth. Crisp. Tasty. Not dry. Not bitter. She has been done well. Frothy, thick, each sip has a thickness to it, like chocolate milk thickness. How did they pull this off? The outdid themselves with this brew! It has a high gravity burn at first but the pumpkin and spices help you recover quickly. Overall: I can't even tell you how amazed I am with this ale. It takes everything that makes Pumking great and goes further with it. A darker, sweeter and higher alcohol Pumking, with hints of halloween candy-ish type flavors blasting you, and honestly I had a few weak bottles of Pumking which I could barely smell. This ale is damn radiant and blasts you every second, from the moment the bottle is open until the last sip. I love it, I love it soooo freaking much! Get this, Halloween fans! Get a few bottles, save it for Halloween, watch some horror movies in the dark with a jack o'lantern lit, sip it slowly and savor all the Halloween flavors. This is the ideal Halloween drink! Happy Halloween, friends :)",5.0,Warlock,American Imperial Stout

102340,BenHoppy,"Finally Prairie you did it! 1st Prairie beer made completely fucking delicious! Been disappointed in Bomb and Paradise but this beer deserves every bit of praise there is. Poured into snifter at cellar temp fresh from the truck: L: dark as night with bubbly chocolatey coffee head that fades quickly A: fudgey rum that reminded me much of Stone bourbon barrel RIS, only difference was that Pirate Bombs taste is even more impressive than the smell. F: nice and thick that's also chewy and creamy yet thin and dissolving all at the same time that finishes with a warming hot pepper finish that warms the throat and gut. T: fudgey chocolate rum with notes of vanilla and coffee along with burning deliciousness of hot peppers. Tastes like your licking bottom of rum barrel as well as a liquidized Lindt hot pepper chocolate candy. O: best rum barrel stout, best chilli pepper stout, and definitely in the top 5 stouts for sure. This beer is just fantastic and the rum is almost bourbon like. The 15% abv sneaks up on you, alcohol so well hidden but halfway through you feel the affects. Should be a slow sipper but tastes so good it finishes way too fast, even when trying to cherish it. This beer is like heaven in a bottle, liquid gold. I strongly suggest drinking it fresh. If I could get another bottle I would totally drink it tomorrow, way too good to age. If you have a bottle open now, can't imagine aging would improve something already so delicious. Highly recommended.",5.0,Pirate Bomb!,American Imperial Stout

Wonderful Hops taste: 5 Initially the taste is calm and sweet, almost like a nut brown lager. This seems to hold back & mask the bitter hops detected on the nose....At First.... After about 2-3 seconds though, the the subtle sweet notes are quickly erased by hops punching you in the mouth. Wonderful Grapefruit and pine bitterness. Then the fun part. For me the bitterness seems to transform. The bitterness evolves into more of a roasted coffee bean bitterness in the finish. Oily & Lingering. A pleasant surprise at the end. feel: 5 Done right. Heavy Carbonation lifts the aromas and this beer has an oily character to it. overall: 5 Will come back for more for sure! One of the best bitters I have tried.",5.0,Dark Penance,American Black Ale

139515,DavidS333,"Rebel Rouser by Samuel Adams is a Double/Imperial IPA. Its smell is somewhat piney and refreshing. The froth level is light on a light/medium/thick scale. The body is half way between light and medium on a similar scale. The color is one of those nice rich/reflective amber colors. The taste is good, and seems focused primarily on that sort of ""steel""-y type of hops. It has a nice bitter aftertaste that sort of lingers more towards the front/tip of one's tongue, and it seems to have that somewhat sort of coating type of aftertaste that isn't a really complete or overbearing coating, but which instead sort of seems to focus on the front of the tongue region. I am familiar with Sam Adams as it is quite a large brewery, and I would say that this is quite a good American Double. Refreshing, and sort of invoking those sort of hoppy qualities that make an American Double tasty. Overall a nice mix of steel and piney hops(most apparently) and quite a good Double IPA overall.",5.0,Samuel Adams Rebel Rouser Double IPA,American Imperial IPA

The legendary Arrogant Bastard and Double Bastard have been my favorites, setting the standard higher than anything else for strong Americal Ales par excellence, and with what an attitude! And now this Kentucky Bourbon Barrel-Aged Bastard... this is just the non plus ultra, really. The icing in the cake (or the beer). Bourbon barrel aging gives the beer a little sweetness in character, making it very rich and sweet, tending towards the direction of a malt whiskey. This Bastard is just such an outstanding masterpiece that you should drink and enjoy with awe, perhaps on special occassions, or on occassions you would want to be made special. I am very impressed and astonished by this beer, actually feels like a bitter barley wine-esque strong ale and actually a bit different from the classic Bastard. Not that arrogant perhaps. But rather elevated and refined. I don't feel my description to be appropriate enough though... so I had rather let it speak for itself and I should stop ""proclaiming my unworthiness to whoever will listen"" - as the bottle says.",5.0,Arrogant Bastard Ale - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,American Strong Ale
